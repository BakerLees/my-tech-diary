* Always assume there's gonna be new browsers in the game - the Internet will be avaiable on many more devices in the near future.
* Even Firefox is [supporting some `-webkit` properties](www.ghacks.net/2015/05/09/mozilla-adds-webkit-prefix-emulation-to-select-sites-in-firefox/) now...WTF-___-
* Wow you guys are really trying very hard...

  > A lot of web sites depend on JavaScript libraries and frameworks, so we also submit fixes to libraries to ensure that they work in all browsers.

#### De facto standards in the Web

1. The missing `url=`.

  Malformed:

  ```html
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;http://foo.com" />
  ```

  Correct:

  ```html
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=http://foo.com" />
  ```
2. It's `utf-8`, not `utf8`!

  Malformed:

  ```html
  <meta charset="utf8"> 
  ```

  Correct:

  ```html
  <meta charset="utf-8"> 
  ```

  IE11- dosen't tolerante the malformed one, but Edge choose to tolerate it
3. Checking CORS headers and `installable` flags for web fonts is now not necessary. The spec say you should, but WebKit works fine without it, so now Edge follows WebKit.
4. The non-standard [`<meta name="viewport">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag)
5. [`scrollTop` bug](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/04/DOM-attributes-now-on-the-prototype)(should've been on the root, but WebKit and Blink put it on the `<body>`)
6. [DOM Attributes on the prototype chain](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/04/DOM-attributes-now-on-the-prototype)
