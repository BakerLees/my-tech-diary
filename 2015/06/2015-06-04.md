### [The Making Of “In Pieces”: Designing an Interactive Exhibition With CSS Clip Paths](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/02/the-making-of-in-pieces/)

Enjoyed that stunning project a few months ago. The making of it sure is  interesting!

1. Drew the shapes in AI
2. Wrote a little tool with JS to generate the parameters for `clip-path`(put the PNG in browser and detect mouse clicks by human)
3. Used color picker to put the colors into Sublime
4. Use numbered background to find the pieces causing edges(anti-aliasing)

### About styling `pre` on mobile

`overflow-x: scroll` is much better than `white-space: pre-wrap` and `word-wrap: break-word. It's easier to swipe than look at the ridiculously wrapped lines.

Almost spent my whole day working on [this](https://github.com/joyeecheung/fountain). I don't like fixed pipeline, but well...I kinda have to use it.
