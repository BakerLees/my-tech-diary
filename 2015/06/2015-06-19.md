### [From ASM.JS to WebAssembly](https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/)

#### [WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly)

* `.wasm`
* Binary, low-level(bytecode)
* Currently more like asm.js, but **will diverge from JS**
* Will still stay equivalent for a while for polyfills via JS
* SIMD
* Zero-cost exceptions, dynamic linking, call/cc

#### Why

* Hot parser for asm.js
* JS is still a bit awkward
* JS and wasm **can diverge**, so no need to introduce inappropriate features into JS(IMO this is the most important point)
