## C/C++

### [What are Aggregates and PODs and how/why are they special?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4178175/what-are-aggregates-and-pods-and-how-why-are-they-special)

Rules for a POD:

1. All of its non-static member should be POD/POD union/POD reference
2. No user-defined **constructor**(use the default)
3. No user-defined **copy assignment operator**(=)
4. No user-defined **destructor**

The layout of a POD is guaranteed(members will be in the order they are declared with). So if you use `memcpy` on it, you can be sure what you copy doesn't change its structure mysteriously.

To check if a class is POD at compile time, do this:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

static_assert(std::is_pod<A>::value, "A must be a POD type.");
```

## CSS

To make your web page black-and-white. For mourning, etc.:

```
body *{
  -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%); /* webkit */
  -moz-filter: grayscale(100%); /*firefox*/
  -ms-filter: grayscale(100%); /*ie9*/
  -o-filter: grayscale(100%); /*opera*/
  filter: grayscale(100%);
  filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(grayscale=1); 
  filter:gray; /*ie9- */
}
```
