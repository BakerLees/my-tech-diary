  * Why ripples instead of fake push-down buttons? Because your finger will never feel the push-down. Ripples are much more natural.
4. Content
  * Bold typography, grids, color palettes
  * Dynamic colors, accent color
5. Icons
  * Real-life shadows, geometric shapes
6. Users initiate change
  * Response should be immediate.

  * Expansion & shadows.
  * Transitions happen around the selected object.
8. Motions
  * Slide instead of fade.

  * Provide guidelines, but still need a human for decisions.
