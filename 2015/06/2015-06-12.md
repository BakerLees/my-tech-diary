## Machine Learning

Turns out I can use [this code](https://github.com/joyeecheung/neural-network) I wrote last year again and again...=___,= All I need to do is tweaking the parameters.

Think of a trick to generate/obtain the classes:

```python
# num_class = y.max()  # if the labels in y is 1 - n
def to_class(y, num_class):
    X, _ = np.meshgrid(list(xrange(num_class)), list(xrange(y.shape[0])))
    return np.array(X == (y - 1)[:, None], dtype=np.float64)

nn.train(train_X, to_class(train_y, train_y.max()))
# remember to add 1 back to the labels
result = np.argmax(nn.fit(test_X), axis=1) + 1
```
