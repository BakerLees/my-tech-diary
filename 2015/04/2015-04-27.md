## Nginx (AOSA2)

### Background
* Bottleneck is usally speed of the network(I/O), not the speed of generating content
* Apache allocates too much memory per connection
  * For persistant connection, it is even worse
  * Web server should scale **non-linearly**!

### Apache's history
* Born to be run as a single instance on a single machine
* One copy per connection(thread/process), scales **linearly**
* C10K problem

### Birth of nginx
* Event-based (the **model** makes the difference)
* Born to handle **static content**, offload concurrency and lantency processing for Apache(side by side)
* Then added
  * FastCGI, uswgi, SCGI, etc
  * Caching system(e.g. memcached/redis)
  * Reverse proxy, load balancing
* Becomes powerful enough to be used without Apache
* Usually, nginx is a **component** in the architecture

### Architecture of nginx
* C-based
* Port to multiple platforms
  * The Windows port (by 2012) is more like a proof-of-concept, it doesn't perform as well as on other platforms

#### Traditional architecture
* Process/thread per connection
* Blocks network or I/O
* Overhead for spawning new process/thread
  * Allocate memory(stack/heap)
  * New execution context(initialization)
  * CPU time(thrashing on excessive context switching)

#### Model of nginx
* Modular
* Event-driven (run-loop)
* Asynchronous
* **Single-threaded** (processes)
  * Limited number of processes called *workers*
* Non-blocking

### Code Structure

* Core
  * Maintains the run-loop
  * Executes sections of modules for each stage of request process
* Modules
  * Presentation and application layer
  * I/O(network, storage)
  * Proxy
  * Transform content
  * Outbound filtering(things that should't be sent out)

#### Core modules
