Hmm...maybe I should write a few demos and toying with them...

## Cool C++ Magic

## ECMAScript
* [ECMAScript Harmony: Rise of the Compilers - Brendan Eich keynote ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlmsweSNhTw)
  * History and future of ES
  * ES7
    * observe, wait, comprehensions, gaurds
  * ES8
    * Macro?! Wow...hello, Scheme?
  * Faster release cycle to avoid specs that no one implements
  * Static typing: TypeScript, Flow, Closure, SoundScript
  * Seems that "JS as assembly" is going to be big..."When we actually have all the affordances in the standard language that allow anybody to compile any language to it, then we'll know that we are done."
  * Things in proposal: typed arrays, shared memory threads, locks...
    * for asm.js coz C++ uses them a lot
    * Web Workers can't share memory
    * Me: ...WTF?!

## Nginx (AOSA2)

### Background
* Bottleneck is usally speed of the network(I/O), not the speed of generating content
* Apache allocates too much memory per connection
  * For persistant connection, it is even worse
  * Web server should scale **non-linearly**!

### Apache's history
* Born to be run as a single instance on a single machine
* One copy per connection(thread/process), scales **linearly**
* C10K problem

### Birth of nginx
* Event-based (the **model** makes the difference)
* Born to handle **static content**, offload concurrency and lantency processing for Apache(side by side)
* Then added
  * FastCGI, uswgi, SCGI, etc
  * Caching system(e.g. memcached/redis)
  * Reverse proxy, load balancing
* Becomes powerful enough to be used without Apache
* Usually, nginx is a **component** in the architecture

### Architecture of nginx
* C-based
* Port to multiple platforms
  * The Windows port (by 2012) is more like a proof-of-concept, it doesn't perform as well as on other platforms

#### Traditional architecture
* Process/thread per connection
* Blocks network or I/O
* Overhead for spawning new process/thread
  * Allocate memory(stack/heap)
  * New execution context(initialization)
  * CPU time(thrashing on excessive context switching)

#### Model of nginx
* Modular
* Event-driven (run-loop)
* Asynchronous
* **Single-threaded** (processes)
  * Limited number of processes called *workers*
* Non-blocking

### Code Structure

* Core
  * Maintains the run-loop
  * Executes sections of modules for each stage of request process
* Modules
  * Presentation and application layer
  * I/O(network, storage)
  * Proxy
  * Transform content
  * Outbound filtering(things that should't be sent out)

#### Core modules
