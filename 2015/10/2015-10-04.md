## UX

### [Introducing RAIL: A User-Centric Model For Performance](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/rail-user-centric-model-performance/)

#### Thresholds

* **100ms** for **response** to user actions
* **1s** for a **task**(e.g. loading web pages, changing views) to complete
* **16ms**(60fps) for **motion**

#### R: Response

* Primary interaction: **tapping**
* Feedback in **< 100ms**
* Longer than that, then the user will start wondering if they really trigger that tap
* If the feedback is going to take longer than that, you need to put on some indicator

#### A: Animation

* Common cases
  * **Visual animation**(entrance, exit, tweened state changes, loading indicators)
  * **Scrolling**
  * **Dragging**
* Feedback in **< 16ms**(60fps)

#### I: Idle

* Common cases
  * Optimistic UI
  * Doing work before the user start to need it(but you predict they will)
  * Bootstrapping comments, initializing components, searching, sorting...
* Group them in about **50ms**, so when the user start to interact, you will likely to provide a timely feedback(in 100ms)

#### L: Load

* Keys
  * Give the user the first meaningful paint quickly
  * Once that's delivered, the app must remain responsive
* Deliver the first meaning full paint in **< 1s**
* Practices
  * Prioritizing the critical rendering path
  * Deferring subsequent non-enssential loads/lazy load on demand

#### Notes

* Mobile devices can be much smaller than your computer
* Look at the analytics to test the 90th percentile's experience
