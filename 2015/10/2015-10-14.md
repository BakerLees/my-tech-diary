### [Async Fragments: Rediscovering Progressive HTML Rendering with Marko](http://www.ebaytechblog.com/2014/12/08/async-fragments-rediscovering-progressive-html-rendering-with-marko/)

#### The key

* Flushing out early and multiple times
* HTML and external resources should be download earlier, the "skeleton" of the page should be rendered earlier


#### Techniques

* Flush the `<head>` section immediately
  * The external CSS can be downloaded early
* Flush fragments one by one(each may rely on different data sources)
  * In-order flushing is easier to handle, but out-of-order flushing is possible too(need to be buffered first)
* Marko can bind template fragments to async data providers, and buffer the fragment so that it will be delivered in-order
* How out-of-order flushing works
  * Render out-of-order fragments into hidden `<div>`s
  * When the fragments are ready, use JavaScript to fill the placeholder with the actual HTML
  * Problems
    * This requires the client to have JS enabled
    * May trigger reflow
