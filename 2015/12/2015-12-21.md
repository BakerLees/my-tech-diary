### [The Inner Workings of the Chakra Javascript Engine â€¢ Steve Lucco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouSoyWj_lSI)

#### Design principles

* Security
* ECMAScript Compliance
* Balanced Performance
  * Throughput, load time, battery consumption
* Transparency - predictable performance for common patterns

#### JIT Security

* JIT spray
* Data Execution Protection
  * Do cryptographic check, turn write permission off, then turn execution permission on - to make sure the code that gets executed is exactly what the JIT compiler emmited.
  * Then you can't just write types like V8 in polymorphic inline caches, because you don't have that write permission
* Codebase alignment randomization
  * Make it harder to guess offsets
* Random NOP insertion
* Constant Blinding
* JIT code allocation cap
* JIT Page randomization

#### Compliance

* Jan 6th, 2010, turned Chakra as the default engine in IE9
* 4000 tests from compatibility tests for corporate apps to Acid3
* ES6 let and const requires synchronous error report
  * Hard to work with deferred parsing
  * Specification go against performance

#### Page load & App startup

* Use interpreter to start ASAP
* Defrred parsing for unused code
* Start-up profile caching - remember which functions were called
  * No additional info, just say where the hotspot is
* Background code generation and garbage collection
* **Page load do not fall into generational hypothesis(most objects die young)** because you are setting up things that won't be destroyed any time soon
* Concurrent GC so the page load won't be blocked

#### GC

* Conservative - works better with native code
  * Can handle object pointers on the native stack, so no additional scope checking, .etc, just look at the stack
  * Tagged intergers lead to very low rate (0.02 per GC) of spurious object references
  * Guest heap/Guest arena
* Generational
  * Partial collections, no seperate nursery space
* Mark and Sweep
  * No compaction/evacuation at that time, not worth the effort, need to run across more pages and cache lines
  * Small objecs sorted by size into buckets for low fragmentation
  * Free-list and bump allocation
* They don't do a lot of things because they don't necesarily need it -- you need an app which is important enough to prove that you need this feature to make it run faster
* Apps over benchmarks

#### Faster property access in IE10

* Object type specialization
* Polymorphic property caches
* Field hoisting
  * If you frequently access a property in a loop, they will put it outside of the loop
  * Hoist type checking
* Copy propagation
* Streamlined object layout
* Function inlining

#### Windows Store Applications

* Bytecode Caching(ha..)
  * Improve load time
* GC on Idle/Suspend
* Fast marshaling to native code
  * Native calling conventions, native exception handling
  * Easier to implement debuggint tools
  * Generation and caching method entry point based on meta-data

#### Roadmap

* Throughput
  * Array operations, typed arrays
  * Polymorphism and function inlining
* Standards
  * ES6 features, ES5 accessor performance
* Improve GC for games and long-running applications
  * Precise pointers
  * Iterate between sequential and concurrent phases

#### FAQ

* About Node
  * Chakra is not cross-platform
  * There are customers using it on the server side
  * Can run 12,000 script contexts with isolation in a process
  * The desicion to make the implementation close to the native code benefit server-side applications
