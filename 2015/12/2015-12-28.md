## Calendar

So I finally got [this](https://github.com/joyeecheung/diary-calendar) sort of working...most of the design follows [the Material Design guideline](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/pickers.html#pickers-date-pickers)


* Migrate to ES6 class(`React.component`)
* Configured a webpack production build
  * You need to set `NODE_ENV` to `production`
  * Be sure to remove sourcemaps
  * The `plugins` looks like this:

    ```javascript
    plugins: [
      new webpack.DefinePlugin({
        'process.env': {
          // This has effect on the react lib size
          'NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production')
        },
      }),
      new webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin(),
      new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({minimize: true}),
      new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin(),
      new webpack.optimize.AggressiveMergingPlugin()
    ]
    ```
* Used css transition group to do animation.
  * [This guide](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) is quite enough
  * It's easier to debug when you tweak the timeout

## CSS

### [The scroll-snap-* Properties](https://webkit.org/demos/scroll-snap/)

Has support in FF, Safari, IE10+. Chrome and Opera doesn't support it though.

### [`:nth-match`](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#nth-match-pseudo)

This CSS4 selector seem to solve one of my problems..It's not implemented yet, but you can use the query selector to polifill it, e.g. to select all even elements in the whole tree

```javascript
var elements = document.querySelector('.someClass');
var even = elements.filter(function(el, i) {
  return i % 2 === 0;
});
```
