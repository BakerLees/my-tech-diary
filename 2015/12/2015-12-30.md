### [New Stack Pancakes n' Podcast Breakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7orcabdg-U)

* OPs
* Tooling e.g. IDE, not just CLI
* Collaboration based on a modular system

#### Architecture

In the enterprise, you always have legacy stacks. Node are usually introduced into a mix of these.

* In the front, starting from pieces, then spread out e.g. Netflix
* Started as a service, then grow in the system e.g. Paypal
* Introduced behind the core service, and the core service calls it e.g. Intuit

#### Tooling

* Maybe local module repositories that can be searched with IDE
* Discipline and education
  * You `npm shrinkwrap` usually because you don't follow semantic versioning
  * People are afraid of changing versions e.g. don't increment version numbers when changing documentations
  * Node itself for a long time avoid 1.0, which leads to people considering major changes as minor

#### The unification

* The team that maintained the old V8 no longer worked on it(they went to work on dart), so it became more difficult for the Node core team to get help when they need to do something about V8
* In 2015 they finally get people on the V8 team sitting in the TSC and help Node.js
  * Node brings use cases for those new language features that are not common in frontend dev transpiled code

#### Node v.s. others

* For frontend-backend, it's much more suitable
* For data access layer, it's more than enough(v.s. Python, go)
* Compared to Java, the classloader problem doesn't exist in Node from the start

#### Node and Windows

* It's a toolchain problem

#### WebAssembly and Polyglot Node

* Can help with native modules(esp. windows)
