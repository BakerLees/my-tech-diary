## JavaScript Engine

### [KinomaJS](http://kinoma.com/develop/documentation/js6/)

This one is now at the leading position of the ES6 compatibility table. Looked into it out of curiosity.

Basically it is a platform for building IoT prototypes. It consists of:

* A few hardware devices
  * [Kinoma Create](http://kinoma.com/create/about/): looks pretty funky to me, has a touchscreen
  * [Kinoma HD](http://kinoma.com/buy/hd-reserve.php): scriptable stick with HDMI output
  * [Kinoma Element](http://kinoma.com/buy/element-reserve.php): kinda like rasperry pi, but it's super small
* A JavaScript application framework called [KinomaJS](http://kinoma.com/develop/documentation/overview)
  * Kinda like the Web
  * Uses JS as the application language(powered by its own JS engine, XS6)
  * Uses XML for building UI/UX(has its own animation and cascading sytle system), and apparently you can emmbed ES into it(looks like it's bulit on top of something called [XS](http://kinoma.com/develop/documentation/xs/), which has a bytecode->VM arthitecture)
  * Has shells for device simulation and remote debugging
  * Uses CommonJS for modules
  * Has a bunch of APIs for all sorts of things e.g. FS
* An Eclipse-based, cross-platform IDE [Kinoma Studio](http://kinoma.com/develop/studio/)
  * Has a visual programming thingy called [KinomaJS Blocks](http://kinoma.com/develop/blockly/), looks interesting

#### Back to the JS engine

The source code is [here](https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs/tree/master/xs6)

* Ad-hoc lexer -> recursive descent parser -> linear bytecode generator -> bytecode generator(no optimization) -> chunked memory + mark-and-sweep GC
* Use PCRE for regex, has a profiler
* It's pretty naive, which explains why it can keep up with the spec.

## Optimizations

* Changing `.html()` to maunal data binding and updates in D3 improves the performance siginificantly: 15ms -> 5ms per frame.
* Too many things going on in a SVG makes painting really slow...
