### [Choosing a Good Hash Function, Part 3](http://research.neustar.biz/2012/02/02/choosing-a-good-hash-function-part-3/)

From volume II of TAOCP:

> If your p-value is less than 0.01 or greater than 0.99 the process that generated those results is almost certainly non-random. Something less than 0.05 or greater than 0.95 should be considered suspect. Finally, he designates a p-value of less than 0.1 or greater than 0.90 as “almost suspect”

* City hash, Spooky hash and Jenkins hash performs fairly well in the keyspace test.
* [FNV hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function) has descent performance in the keyspace test too(and it's considerably simpler)
* Murmur3 and Spooky performs best in the Avalanche
