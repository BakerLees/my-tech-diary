## React

### [Should I use React.createClass, ES6 Classes or stateless functional components?](http://jamesknelson.com/should-i-use-react-createclass-es6-classes-or-stateless-functional-components/)

* Rule 1: If your component needs to access `this`, use ES6 Classes
  * `React.createElement`(of the `<>`) creates `ReactElement` -- pure JS object
  * Calling `render` creates the actual component, `ReactComponent`, and attach it to the DOM. It has the `this` reference, `states`, `refs` and all
  * When using stateless functional components(which doesn't have `this`), React doesn't need `ReactComponent` anymore, then it can do some optimiaztions with this priori
* Rule 2: If your components need **lifecycle methods**, use ES6 classes
* Golden Rule: **If you can use a Stateless Functional Component, then do so. Otherwise, use ES6 Classes.**

#### Why `React.component` over `React.createClass`

* Smaller but equally powerful API
  * Better for HOC, deprecate mixins
  * Only binds the methods that are required, imrpoving performace and less likely to be deprecated

## Data Visualization

### [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega/)

* Describe interactive visualizations in JSON -> rendered in canvas/SVG
* Has [reactive extensions](https://github.com/vega/vega/wiki/Signals), use FRP to describe the interactions. (Ref: [Declarative Interaction Design for Data Visualization](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2014-DeclarativeInteraction-UIST.pdf))
* Use [markers](https://github.com/vega/vega/wiki/Marks) to describe the building blocks(Ref: [Declarative Language Design for Interactive Visualization](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-Protovis-InfoVis.pdf))
* [Isomorphic](https://github.com/vega/vega/wiki/Headless-Mode)
Vega

#### How about D3?

* Check [this](https://github.com/vega/vega/wiki/Vega-and-D3) out.
* D3 is much more low-level
* Vega is more reusable and shareable
* Vega can be a compilation target
* Vega has an abstraction layer to provide multiple rendering targets
