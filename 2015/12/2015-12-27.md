## Koa

* Koa router can't handle calling `routes()` multiple times. Got to construct a new router every time.

  Like this

  ```javascript
  function nestedRouter() {
    var router = new Router();
    router.use(...);
    return router;
  }

  var outerRouter1 = new Router();
  var outerRouter2 = new Router();

  outerRouter1.use(nestedRouter().routes());
  outerRouter2.use(nestedRouter().routes());
  ```
* Koa-component@3.0 has [breaking changes](https://github.com/koajs/compose/issues/35).
* When using muk to mock the dependencies, modify require cache in `brefore` hook, then restore in `after` hook.
  * It doesn't mock things deep down the require chain, you need to directly modify the module required in your tested module, instead of modify the module that is required by that required module
