## Bug

Firefox can't handle this:

```html
<a>
  <img src="http://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/m.svg"></img>
</a>
```

```css
a {
  display: inline-block;
}

img {
  width: 80%;
}
```

## C++

### [Announcing Visual C++ Build Tools 2015 â€“ standalone C++ tools for build environments](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/11/02/announcing-visual-c-build-tools-2015-standalone-c-tools-for-build-environments.aspx)

This contains:

* VC++ Compilers(x86, x64 and ARM)
* VC++ headers & libraries(CRT & STL)
* VC++ build scripts
* Microsoft Build Tools 2015 (MSBuild)
* (Optional) Windows SDK 8.1 & 10
* C++ build tools specific command prompts

This standalone version needs about 3GB space, much smaller than what VS requires(though it is still much larger than other compilers like clang/gcc).

This could shed a light for those who need to install native Node.js add-on on Windows.
