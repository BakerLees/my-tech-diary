### [Why We Need a Dispatcher](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/07/30/flux-actions-and-the-dispatcher.html#why-we-need-a-dispatcher)

* Provide `waitFor()` to resolve the dependencies among stores
* `dispatch()` method provides a simple, **synchronous iteration** through the callbacks, invoking each in turn.
* When `waitFor()` is encountered in a callback, the execution stops, and **a new iteration cycle over the dependencies** is created. The callback will be resumed after all the dependencies are updated
* By calling `waitFor()` inside code blocks(say, in `switch` blocks), we can have fine-grained control over the dependencies(different dependencies for different actions)
* Circular dependencies are avoided by throwing errors in the dispatcher in Flux repo
