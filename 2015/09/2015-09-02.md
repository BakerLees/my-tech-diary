### [AngularJSâ€™ Internals In Depth](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/01/angularjs-internals-in-depth/)

#### Scopes

* Abstraction of communication between directives and the OM
* Also exists in the conrollers
* Plain old JavaScript objects(POJO)
* Internal properties prefixed with `$` or `$$`
* Associated with an element and all its children, but an element is not necessarily directly associated with a scope
* Element are assigned a scope by:
  * Adding a controller/directive to an element
  * Inheriting from its parent
  * Note if the element isn't inside an `ng-app` then it **doesn't belong to a scope**!
* To access an element's scope: `angular.element(domElement).scope()`(if you are using jQuery, `$(domElement).scope()` works too)
