## JS/V8

### [Optimization killers](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers)

* Inner functions that contain pattern for bailout will affect the containing function

#### How to find out the patterns

1. Make a function that contains the pattern
2. The return value of `%GetOptimizationStatus(fn)` shows to what degree is the function `fn` optimized.
3. Call it two times to go from `uninitialized` to `monomorphic`
4. Use `%OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall(fn)` to instruct the V8 to optimize this function immediately
