### [Visually what happens to fork() in a For Loop](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26793402/visually-what-happens-to-fork-in-a-for-loop)

* Notice that the child process(before writing) will share the memory of the parent process, so it won't start again from 0
* The parent process runs before the child process

## [The difference between fork(), vfork(), exec() and clone()](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4856255/the-difference-between-fork-vfork-exec-and-clone)

* `fork()`: Old implementations copy the entire memory space of the parent process, but it's now copy-on-write.
  * Child process has a new PID and a corresponding PPID.
  * The child gets 0 as the return value of `fork()`, the parent gets the PID of the child. You can use this to tell who is who.
* `vfork()`: a legacy implementation for a more efficient `fork()`. It doesn't copy, -- at all.
  * It will suspend the parent process until the child exits or calls `execve()`
  * It's dangerous since
    * You might overwrite the shared memory space.
    * If you return from the function containing the `vfork()`, it will wreck the stack
    * Don't call `exit()` in the child, call `_exit()`(It's also true for `fork()`)
* `exec()`: replace the entire current process with a newly loaded program. It never returns to the original program.
* `clone()`: Allows sharing of execution context with special data structures.

## C

### [Macros](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macros.html#Macros)

#### Self-reference rule

There are no recursions.

```c
#define foo (4 + foo)
```

will not be expanded into

```c
#define foo (4 + (4 + foo))
```

and more...It will stop after one step. So whenever you write `foo` in your program, it will expand to `4 + foo`, and that's it.

#### Indirect self-referenc

No recursions either.

```c
#define x (4 + y)
#define y (2 * x)
```

Then

```c
x // => (4 + y)
  // => (4 + (2 * x))
 
y // => (2 * x)
  // => (2 * (4 + y))
```

## [Bash Syntax Recap](http://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial)

Bash uses spaces, not commas.

### Variables

```bash
# declare with `=`
STRING="Hello World"
# use with `$`
echo $STRING
# execute command, store into variables
OF=myhome_directory_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz

# local with `local`
function fn {
local VAR="local variable"
echo $VAR
}
```

### CLI arguments

```bash
# access CLI arguments
echo $1 $2 $3
# as array
args=("$@")
echo ${args[0]} ${args[1]} ${args[2]}
# as whole
echo $@
# count
echo $#
```

### Execute commands

use backticks.

### Read input

```bash
# use named variables
read word1 word2
echo $word1 $word2
# or use built-in $REPLY
read
echo $REPLY
# read into array
read -a arr
echo ${arr[0]} ${arr[1]}
```

### Array

Use `()` and spaces

```bash
ARRAY=( 'Debian Linux' 'Redhat Linux' Ubuntu Linux )
# count
echo ${#ARRAY[@]}
# as whole
echo ${ARRAY[@]}

# loop elements
for (( i=0;i<$ELEMENTS;i++)); do
    echo ${ARRAY[${i}]}
done 
```

### Conditions

```bash
directory="./foo"

# spaces inside `[]` are needed!
# `; then` is needed, and `fi`
if [ -d $directory ]; then
  echo "Directory exists"
elif
  ...
else 
  echo "Directory does not exists"
fi

# cases
case $case in
  1) echo "You selected 1";;
  2) echo "You selected 2";;
  3) echo "You selected 3";;
  4) echo "You selected 4";;
  5) exit
esac
```

### Comparisons/testing

```bash
# notice `[]`.
if [ $NUM1 -eq $NUM2 ]; then
  ...
fi
```

Note: use `-lt`, `-gt`, `le`, `-ge`, `-eq` for numbers.

```bash
if [ $S1 = $S2 ]; then
  ...
fi
```

Note: use `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>` for strings. `-n s1` for non-empty check, `-z s` for empty check

Files: `-d` for directory existence, `-e` for file/directory existence, `-f` for regular file existence(not directory/device), `-S` for socket, `-s` for non-zero size

### Loops

```bash
# for...in. needs `do` and `done`.
for f in $( ls /var/ ); do
  echo $f
done 

# use let to reassign
COUNT=6
while [ $COUNT -gt 0 ]; do
  echo Value of count is: $COUNT
  let COUNT=COUNT-1
done

COUNT=0
until [ $COUNT -gt 5 ]; do
        echo Value of count is: $COUNT
        let COUNT=COUNT+1
done
```

### Escaping

```bash
echo \$BASH_VAR  # $BASH_VAR
echo "\\" # \
```
