## CSS

Discover a peculiar bug where IE7 won't apply `margin-left` to `float: left` divs, and solved it by adding classes to that div to force a reflow.

The typical symptom: you apply the CSS via JS, it doesn't work -> you tweak the styles in the devtools, it works immediately -> you access that element in the console, it works immediately -> et voila, you need a reflow to fix this bug!

The simples way to trigger a reflow: add a class, like `reflow`.
