## CSS Secrets

### CSS Coding Tips

* Minimizing the amount of edits necessary to make a change
* When values depend on each other, try to reflect their relationship in the code(typically with decimal numbers/percentages/em/rem)
* `currentColor`
* Inheritance(border, background, etc.)
* Media queries incur more future modifications. They should be a last resort.
* Media query breakpoints should be dedicated to the design, not specific devices
* `max-width: 100%` on replaced elements e.g. `img`, `video`, `iframe`
* `background-size: cover`
* Use viewport-relative units(e.g. `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax`)
* Prefer liquid layout, relative sizing
* Shorthands are good at defense, and they can help you to cope with future properties.
* Only repeat what is necessary
