## JS Engine

### [A tour of V8: full compiler](http://jayconrod.com/posts/51/a-tour-of-v8-full-compiler)

#### High level architecture

* V8 has a full compiler and an optimizing compiler. There's no interpreter, everything will be compiled to machine code.
* Full compiler compiles JS code without any transformation/optimization. It's job is to make the code available to run as quickly as possible, so the web pages can load quickly.
* The optimizing compiler(Crankshaft) will optimize hot functions selected by the profiler
* Additional notes(not in this article)
  * V8 now has multiple threads for these. The main thread does compilation and execution, and there is another one just for compilation. Profiler is on another, and there are a few more for GC.
  * The main thread will stop execution when doing Crankshaft optimizations
  * Optimization is done on the Hydrogen(a static-single assignment representation of the control flow graph)

#### Why no bytecode?

* Native compilation is not that more expensive than bytecode compilation.
* You still need to go through parsing, scope analysis(for local variables, content variables(closures), global properties).
* The only difference is that during code generation, you generate machine code(platform-specific) instead of bytecode(platform-independent)
* In V8 we just skip the translation from bytecode to machine code. This simplifies transitions between unoptimized and optimized code!
