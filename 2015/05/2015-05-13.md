## Edge

### [JavaScript moves forward in Microsoft Edge with ECMAScript 6 and beyond](http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/12/javascript-moves-forward-in-microsoft-edge-with-ecmascript-6-and-beyond/)

#### Class

Spec changed late in the process...well, wait for update.

#### Default parameters
Intermediate scope of default parameter initializers are particularly hard to implement.

Chakra can handle this:

```javascript
function fn() { return "outside" }

function outer(a = fn()) {
  function fn() { return "inside" }
  return a;
}

outer();  // should return "outside"
```

But not this (yet):

```javascript
let x = "outside";

function outer(a = () => eval("x")) {
  let x = "inside";
  return a();
}

outer();  // should return "outside"
```

(Wow...May I say that the second one is just pure evil....)

#### Generators

The spec later added `return()` to the iterator interface, which would alter behaviors of other language features. They need time to catch up on that.

#### Trickery
1.Phishing
  * Old: HTTPS lock symbol, EV Cert green bar
  * New: Windows 10 Microsoft Passport, no need to send plain-text password
2. Malicious Websites and Downloads
  * SmartScreen: reputation check
3. Fake Sites
  * Certificate reputation
4. Web Standards
  * [IETF HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-websec-strict-transport-sec-14.txt)
  * [W3C Content Security Policy 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-CSP-20121115/)

#### Hacking

1. A new extension model, get rid of ActiveX
2. Microsoft Edge as a Universal Windows App
  * New process model
  * App container sandbox by default(since ActiveX is gone)
  * 64-bit by default, stronger Windows ASLR


### [A break from the past, part 2: Saying goodbye to ActiveX, VBScript, attachEvent…](http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/06/a-break-from-the-past-part-2-saying-goodbye-to-activex-vbscript-attachevent/)

#### Why these are gone in Edge
* ActiveX and BHO
  * HTML5 is powerful enough
  * PDF viewer and Flash will be built in
  * A new extension model is coming
* Document modes
  * Living mode
  * Just use `about://flags` for experimental feature, the stable ones will be turned on by default
* VML
  * We have SVG now
* VBScript
  * JavaScript is enough
* `attachEvent` / `removeEvent`
  * DOM Level 3 `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` since IE9
* `currentStyle`
  * DOM Level 2 `getComputedStyle` since IE9
* Conditional comments
  * Feature detection is the right way to go
* IE8 layout quirks
  * (It sucks)
* DirectX Filters and Transitions
  * We have CSS3 and SVG

#### Vender prefixes
* Remove many `-ms`, added many `-webkit` (...WTF)
* Only for compatibility
* Prefer `about:flags`
* Maybe [API trials](https://air.mozilla.org/web-compatibility-summit-talks/)

## [Deku: How we built our functional alternative to React](https://segment.com/blog/deku-our-functional-alternative-to-react/)

* Doesn't support old browsers, smaller codebase (< 10kb)
* Initially a rendering loop with dirty checks
* An optimized [diffing algorithm](https://github.com/segmentio/deku/blob/master/lib/render.js#L492)
* [Uses ES6 modules](https://github.com/segmentio/deku/blob/master/docs/guides/components.md) instead of classes and `this` (WOW!)
