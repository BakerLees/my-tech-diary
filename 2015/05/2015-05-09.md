## [The Future of TypeScript: ECMAScript 6, Async/Await and Richer Libraries](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2015/3-644)

* Static types and future ES
* Optional typing, tooling lights up during annotation, completion, documentaton, refectoring, definitions and references
* TSD files(like .h files) and [Definitely types](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped)
* Angular 2 and AtScript
* Different compile targets: ES3, ES5, ES6
* Infers types and recognizes type guards
* Type checking goes away in compiled code
* TS Server(using node) talks to editors/plugins with a JSON protocol. You don't need to write the parser and semantics analyzer youself.
* TS 2.0: later this year, 100% ES6 compliance


##[Whatâ€™s New in JavaScript for Fast and Scalable Apps](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2015/2-763)

### Arrow functions
* lexical `this`, `arguments` and `super`
* Gotcha: Blocks(`let`+curly braces) needs explicit `return`(inside the curly braces)
  * This

    ```javascript
    let wat = () => {name: 'blah'};
    console.log(wat());
    ```
    will give you `undefined`, you need to `return`:

    ```javascript
    let wat = () => {return {name: 'blah'}};
    console.log(wat());
    ```
    or use parentheses to tell the interpreter that you are giving an expression:
    ```javascript
    let wat = () => ({name: 'blah'});
    console.log(wat());
    ```
