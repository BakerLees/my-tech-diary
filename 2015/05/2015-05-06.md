### [Whatâ€™s New in F12 for "Project Spartan"](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2015/3-638)
* Tools for IE 11 on Win10+ are going to be **frozen**!!
* Edge will cover much more features common in browsers
* Unique features in Edge:
  * Track changes (uh...Chrome has that (workspace) since, like, two years ago?)
  * Just my code (well...Both Chrome and Firefox already have some sort of blackbox thing in the JS debugger...)
* DEMOS
  * F12 for embedded IE
    * `F12Chooser.exe` will enumerate all IE instances to let you choose between them
    * Also available in VS
    * These tools are built in HTML-CSS-TypeScript
    * You can debug F12 with F12 LOL
  * Brand new network tool
    * Network tool is on without F12
    * Plan to add cookie editor(for now it is read-only)
    * HAR Support
  * **TypeScript goodies**
    * Go to definition
    * Find references
  * Keep shortcuts the same as other browsers
  * Some not-so-new features
    * Event breakpoints(finally!)
    * Async call stack
    * Source maps
    * Source file reminder for console.log(also works for source maps)
  * CSS pre/postprocessors with source maps will also have **go to definition** (uh..without ctags?)
  * Brand new profiling tool (finally)
    * [User Timing API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webperformance/usertiming/)(Yeah I am looking at you, FireFox!)
    * Jump from performance tool to DOM inspector(with highlights)
    * Uses CPU sampling instead of instrumented page to reduce overhead on profiling
    * First time is always slower because the JIT didn't take effects
    * F12 turns on debug mode for JS so it affects the data recorded by `window.performance`, this is a problem when you are sending performance statistics from users' machine to your server. Plan to add a control to disable debug mode.
    * Snapshots (nah...other browsers have it already)
      * `console.takeHeapSnapshot()`

## Microsoft Edge

* Will be updated frequently
* No more ActiveX and VBScript
* Hosted Web Apps(have a URL in the manifest) can access **Universal Windows API** via JavaScript (device, etc. things that are not in the standard)
  * Feature detect `window.Windows`
    * e.g. Create an appointment

      ```javascript
      if (window.Windows) {
        Windows.ApplicationModel.Appointments.Appointment();
      }
      ```
* Rolling releases like Windows 10
* Certification: a team working on regular reviews, focusing on apps with many customer complaints
