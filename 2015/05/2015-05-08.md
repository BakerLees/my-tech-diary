> Right now we're releasing Windows 10, and because Windows 10 is the last version of Windows, we're all still working on Windows 10.

Yay!

## Graceful degradation, progressive enhancement
[Graceful degradation versus progressive enhancement](http://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement)

* Graceful degradation: build for the latest and the best browsers first, when the user uses an old browser, tell them the functionality won't work or just display a less nice-looking page(you might **leave something deformed** on your page).
* Progressive enhancement: build for all common browsers first, then add advanced functionality for newer browsers. If something won't work in the old browser, just don't add it to the basic version(you **don't even leave a trace** for anything that wouldn't work in old browsers).
