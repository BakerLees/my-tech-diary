## The Web

### [JavaScript in 2016: Beyond Harmony](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/brendan-eich-javascript-fluent-2016)

* Progressive Web App
* The Web is not minimalist
* Compatibilities
* Decorators are coming
* WebAssembly is coming in this year
  * Self-verifying, goto-free bitcode, not bytecode
  * ML specification(definitional interpreter, with tests)
  * *This is my revenge on being told to make it look like Java when I was doing JavaScript in 10 days* LOL
* JavaScript is not Unix, but WebAssembly is.

### [Intersection Observers Explained](https://github.com/WICG/IntersectionObserver/blob/master/explainer.md)

* Observes intersection of elements(viewport included) as its name suggests
* The current API seems really weird...

#### Use cases

* Lazy load
* Infinite list(recycle out-of-view elements and pre-loading)
* Ads

#### Properties

* No hard latency requirements. Thus async.
* Poorly supported by any combination of other APIs

#### Advantages

* No need to hijack the scroll handler(common source of jank)
* Offscreen elements can do nothing until they come into view
* No polling/synchronous layouts, no force layouts

### [How npm split a monolith and lived to tell the tale](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-npm-split-a-monolith-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale)

* Gall's law: *A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.*
* Things just start as monolith. Don't try to scale it before you need to scale it

#### How it's done

1. Don't rewrite the whole system. Rewrite a subsystem first, make it a standalone microservice
2. Use a proxy to route requests to this new microservice
3. Get those tarballs out of couchdb, put them behind an nginx static server, and use varnish VCL for proxy
4. Write a smarter frontdoor to replace varnish proxy
5. Rewrite authentication, validation, and storage logic
6. Scale it horizontally, keep rewriting the system
