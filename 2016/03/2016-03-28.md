### [Would type annotations help PyPy’s performance?](http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/faq.html#would-type-annotations-help-pypy-s-performance)

* Cython types changes the Python semantics, which brings extra performance
* PEP 484 doesn't help performance at all
  * The hints are just **hints**, they must still be checked at runtime
  * If VM trusts the hints completely, then when the annotations are wrong there will be some pretty nasty crashes
* Why
  * PEP 484 hints don't exactly correspond to the "hidden types" that JIT infers under the hood(e.g. PEP 484 `int` doesn't necessarily fits inside one machine word, and allows `int` subclasses)
  * To produce good code, you need more than just types(e.g. profiling information)
  * Some "guards" in PyPy’s JIT traces doesn't have a obvious coressponding type

P.S. Having type hints doesn't mean that the parser doesn't need to infer types anymore - they still does, in order to **check the type they infer against what you hint**. So, type hints are useful because they can help developers catch bugs before the code runs, not because they can alleviate the burden on the compilers.
