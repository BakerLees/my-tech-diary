## VR

### [UI/UX design for WebVR with Josh Carpenter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOaOYTOpwyM)

* It looks really amazing when OR is plugged in...
* The Web is not just the browser
* Problems with the early VR
  * Fragmented market
  * Hard to install
  * Proprietary
* Pros of WebVR
  * The world can be linked
  * Safe as a sandbox
  * Easier to develop
  * Intergrate existing content
  * Interoperablity
* Problems & Ideas
  * Let the user customize the viewport(transparent, shape, size, curved, etc.)
  * The transition between classic sites and VR sites
  * The transition bewteen VR sites(maybe the user can customize this)
  * There will be much more room for creativity in VR browsing experience(compared to mobile)

1. Get all the devices
2. Classify them into HMD and sensors and associate them
3. Render your scene into two view ports correctly(otherwise your users will be sick)
  * The distortion would pull down the resolution, so actually you need a bigger rendered image at disposal
  * `gHmd.getRecommendedEyeRenderRect` helps you to shape your viewport
  * `gHmd.getRecommendedEyeFieldOfView` helps you calculate the projection matrix
  * `gHmd.getEyeTranslation` help you to calculate the view matrix
  * Remember([ref](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/))

    ```
    TransformedVector = TranslationMatrix * RotationMatrix * ScaleMatrix * OriginalVector;
    MVPmatrix = projection * view * model
    ```
4. Enter Fullscreen mode
  * Pincushoin distortion correction, chromatic aberration correction, timewarp, correct `requestAnimationFrame`, etc.

And, all of these are done for you by THREE.js via `THREE.VRControls` and `THREE.VREffect`!

#### Tips

* [Fast Stereo Rendering for VR](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19x9XDjUvkW_9gsfsMQzt3hZbRNziVsoCEHOn4AercAc/mobilepresent?pli=1&slide=id.p)
* Favor lightweight vertex shaders
* Be willing to reduce canvas resolution
  * Framerate matters much more
* You don't need to render non-view depdent things twice(for both eyes)
  * Shadow maps, environment maps
* You might not need to switch the scene, just swap the viewport and draw the objects
