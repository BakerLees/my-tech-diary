### [Self-hosted JS - Andy Wingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFFvNQWf3Iw)

#### JS is faster than C++

* JS can optimize at runtime
  * Dynamic inlining e.g. `forEach`
  * Inline allocations e.g. scalar replacement, allocating GC objects by incrementing pointers
  * Inline hard-wiring of user object shapes(slot offsets, getters)
* No overhead between JS <-> C++
  * Especially important for callbacks
  * [Make it possible to implement JS builtins in JS](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/163960)
* JS matches JS semantics better
  * Proxies, accessors, order of effects, hash-property v.s. get-property, user-implemented iteration protocol, exceptions, catch, `for-of`
  * Easier to maintain
* JS is more secure than C++
  * No more GC-related bugs
  * No more integer overflow, use-after-free, .etc

#### JavaScriptCore

* Function source is compiled separately
* Access to globals is forbidden in general. Initial values can be accessed via `@` prefix, e.g. `@Object`

#### SpiderMonkey

* More like what you write in normal JS, but is still somewhat limited
* Will be concatnated

#### V8

* Two global objects: `builtins` for self-hosted JS to access, and `global` to be exported
* `InternalArray`(so you don't have to worry about user polluting prototypes)
* "natives" refers to JavaScript functions
* `%` prefix for low-level C++ runtime functions `--allow-natives-syntax`
* `%_` prefix for magical "inline" runtime functions(`%_CallFunction`, `%IsSmi`)
* Caps an underscores for macros(`TO_UNIT32`, `IS_NUMBER`)
* Suggested reading order: `runtime.js` -> `v8natives.js` -> `array.js`
* The snapshot process: The heap will be built and serialized at build-time, and stored in the disk. Whenever you open a new tab, this heap will be loaded to *boot* the new world
