## Testing UI(React)

### [Enzyme: JavaScript Testing utilities for React](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/enzyme-javascript-testing-utilities-for-react-a417e5e5090f#.b9eyatpaj)

* Pure functions (and thus React components) are much easier to test because they return descriptions instead of real DOM objects
* Actually testing for the rendered tree would be a terrible idea because that introduces too much coupling. What you need is a framework to hide those detail for you
* Three modes
  * [shallow](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) - recommended because it helps isolation
  * [mount](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) - full DOM rendering(useful when you need to access the DOM API or the lifecycle)
  * [render](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/render.html) - static HTML rendering

```jsx
const spy = sinon.spy();
const item = mockItem();
const wrapper = shallow(<ToDoItem item={item} onCompleteChange={spy} />);
expect(wrapper.text()).to.contain(item.title);
wrapper.find('.item-button').simulate('click');
expect(spy.calledOnce).to.be.true;
expect(spy.calledWith(item, false)).to.be.true;
```

* Testing pure function `view = f(state)` should've been easy
* The nesting of views compilicates the testing, your testing code ends up coupling with the implementation of your component(testing for `output.props.children[0].props.children[0]` and whatnot)
* Enzyme provides a jQuery-like wrapper that wraps around the virtual DOM to help you reach the part you want to test easier and simulate events your you
* You can view the part of the virtual DOM tree that you want to focus on by logging `wrapper.find(...).debug()`
* For react native, this **mocks** all the react API that you need to mock so you can focus on testing easily
