## WebVR

### [Moving towards WebVR 1.0](http://blog.tojicode.com/2016/02/moving-towards-webvr-10.html)

#### Focus on WebGL

* It's not that easy to make 2D DOM elements available in the 3D space of VR, so this has been put on hold and the focus is now exclusively on WebGL
* Use libraries like [a-frame](https://aframe.io/) if you still want declarative syntax

#### How to get the features

* `VRPositionSensorDevice` and `VRHMDDevice` are combined into `VRDisplay`. No more iterations, just get the features directly.

#### Compositors

* It's not about *fullscreen* anymore. Now you have **compositor** objects(only available when the user makes a gesture) and can set the source of the VR frames to render contents on(currently it's either an `HTMLCanvasElement` or `OffscreenCanvas`)
* Each compositor will have their own `requestAnimationFrame`
* With this the developers will have more control about the display of the content(one eye, both eye, special view, .etc)

#### `DOMPoint` -> `TypedArrays`

* Vectors, quaternions and matrices are now in `Float32Array`s
* Better adoption(since it's in ES6), better performance, and can be used with SIMD APIs

#### Enable "Room Scale" experiences

* Users can move around in a large area
* Report position and orientation upon `resetPose`("sitting space")
* `stageParameters` provides info including transform matrix for the"standing space" and dimensions of the play area

#### Others

* `VRDisplay.capabilities`(for positional and orientational data report, existence of external display)
* Rename a lot of stuff
* Remove a lot of stuff
* New controllers should be exposed in the gamepad API

Tell a story with VR

#### Why the Web?

* Progressive enhancement, people without VR devices can still enjoy it
* Cross-platform, no need to download & install

#### Getting the data

* Browsers don't support TIFF
* PNG only support 256 different height values per pixel
* ENVI supports 2^16 possible height values
* Use the GADL GIS library to convert TIFF to ENVI
* [number of data points, number of vertices]
  * Too high, it will stress out the GPU. Too low, the details will be lost
  * 300x285 is good for PC, 200x190 is good for phones, 100x95 is good for some lighter phones.

#### Creating the scene

* Three.js and [WebVR Boilerplate](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate)
* Desktop and laptops gets *fly* control via keyboard and mouse, mobiles get *VR* control via orientation
* Use simplified geometry and raycasting for collision detection

#### Tour

* Use Bezier curves for routing
* Add a midpoint to make the curve, use the distance to determine its height

#### Caveats and pitfalls

* Browser chrome takes up space on mobile devices
* Can't autoplay audios
* No UX standards yet for devices like Google Cardboard
