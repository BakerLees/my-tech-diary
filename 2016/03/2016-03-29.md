### [What makes JNI calls slow?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7699020/what-makes-jni-calls-slow)

* Native method calls **can't be inlined or JIT'ed**, because they are already compiled
  * Note that *standard* native code, however, could be inlined in the JVM
  * [Intrinsic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_function) can be quite fast though
* In native code **Java arrays may be copied** around for access, instead of just having their references being passed around
* If the method is passed an object or needs to make a callback, it will likely make **calls to the JVM**
* Accesing Java fields, methods and types requires stuff similar to **reflection**, **signatures** will be specified and queried from the JVM, which is slow and error-prone
* Accessing or creating strings may require `O(n)` copies

### [Best practices for using the Java Native Interface](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jni/)

* Cache method IDs, field IDs, and classes because the lookup can be expensive(the JVM needs to walk up the class hierachy)
* Use `Get[Type]ArrayRegion()` and `Set[Type]ArrayRegion()` to access **regions** of arrays instead of the full arrays, so that the JVM would not copy the whole array(it's not specified in the spec but JVMs might have to do it when the underlying structure of arrays is optimized). But never mind if you want to iterate over the whole array anyway.
* Pass individual fields instead of the whole object, since accessing fields would required a call back into the JVM
* The boundary between the native and the Java code should minimize the transitions between these two. Data should be maintained mostly on one side only.
* Delete local references returned by JNI functions(`DeleteLocalRef`) when they are no longer needed in your native code, especially when you are creating them in a loop.
  * Or use `EnsureLocalCapacity()` to tell the JVM that you are going to use more than 16 local references so it can optimize this.
