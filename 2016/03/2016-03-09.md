## UI & JavaScript

### [Pioneering application design on TVs & TV-connected devices](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/12/pioneering-application-design-on-tvs-tv.html)

* Flash -> QtWebKit -> Their own UI framework(like an stripped down version of WebKit)
* The characteristics of the Netflix app: long-lived, single page, image and video heavy, run on a wide range of devices(from powerful play stations to cheap TV sticks)
* Optimized for fast 2D rendering of images, text and color fills, close-to-the-metal
* The rendering surfaces(bitmap data) are similar to  accelerated compositing surfaces in modern browsers
* A pluggable cinematic effect pipeline with blur, desaturation, masking and tinting
* The scripting language was still JavaScript, powered by JavaScriptCore(V8 and SpiderMonkey didn't have enough support for different chipsets)
* The framework integrated with a Node server using the WebKit remote debugging protocol. Developers can use WebKit devtools(Elements, Sources, Network and Timeline tab worked the same way as they were in the browser)

### [Netflix JavaScript Talks - React.js for TV UIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sETJs2_jwo)

* JSC on a $30 streaming device(like Roku, with a 600mhz single core and a very small L1 cahe)without JIT is about 465x slower than V8 on a developer's laptop
* Gibbon(replaces WebKit)
  * Custom rendering framework
  * Primitive boxes
  * 60fps render loop
* react-gibbon
  * Built on top of react-dom, sort of like React Native but it's for TV
  * Place for hooks like focus, animation, layout
  * Things like react-router can be used now


#### Architecture Principles

* Unidirectional flow
  * Unified, immutable data
* Composition over inheritance
  * No ES6 classes for performance reasons
  * Use mixins over HOC
  * HOC are like onions, the order is clearer
  * Swappable data layer(relay, falcor, static data for testing, redux, .etc)
* Always declarative
  * LRUD pointers
  * Focus with refs could be terrible
  * `onRightKey -> this.items[1].focus() -> this.image.focus()` will quickly adds a lot of coupling to your code. It would be hard to change the hierarchy of your component tree
  * It would be worse if your events are async
  * `setState({focusId: 1} => <Item focus={true}/> => Image.focus={true} )`
  * This also helps with performance optimizations

#### Optimization

* Measure
* HOC are costly
  * Components -> transducers, higher order components to higher order functions
    * componentWillReceviveProps -> reduce/scan
    * setState -> onNext(async)
    * render -> map
    * this -> nothing(stateless)
* PureCompositeComponent
  * Elimite the slow `Object.assign` shim(10x faster)
  * Skip ref reconciliation
  * Simpler lifecycle, just `getNextState` and `render`
  * Components with only render: 0.32ms -> 0.08ms
  * Components with states: 0.75ms -> 0.1ms
  * Components with context: 0.86ms -> 0.12ms
  * Simple recursion: 0.04ms
* Skipping `ref` and uses props forces more diffs
  * Separate props static from dynamic
  * Customize Babel transform and throw in static analysis to find diff points
  * Let the user specify the diff point, and hoist the diffing function out - this can be inlined during transformation and be super fast
  * JSX is a compiler hint - you can walk backwards and optimize things
* Babel element inliner
  * `React.createElement` is expensive
    * `new ReactElement` and `props` copy are expensivy
  * Replace(inline) JSX with plain objects during transformation
