## Node.js

#### Optimize

* Use Restify
  * It can give you the time spent on each middleware via `req.timers`
* Use `perf` to sample the stack traces from the running production processes without effecting the performace
  * This miss the JavaScript frames because the code is JIT'ed
  * Use `node --perf_basic_prof_only_functions`
  * Output a file that translate native memory address for JIT'ed code to actual JavaScript files and line numbers
  * Small impact on the processes
* Replace `_.merge` with `_.assign` to eliminate unnecesary recurive copying

#### Crashes

* Use `--abort-on-uncaught-exception` to get core dumps
* Tools: [lldb-v8](https://github.com/tjfontaine/lldb-v8), [llnode](https://github.com/indutny/llnode), [mdb_v8](https://github.com/joyent/mdb_v8)
* Commands
  * `::jsstack` for detailed stack trace
  * `::jsstack -vn0` for function args for each frame
  * `::jsprint` and `::jsconstructor` for state and provenance of objects
  * `::jssource` for source code of any function
  * `::findjsobjects` to find arbitrary JS objects(with memory addresses)
* Name your functions!!

#### Memory leaks

* How to do it
  * Take successive dumps with`gcore`
  * Compare object counts with `::findjsobjects`, find the suspicious objects(with growing counts)
  * Inspect the object for more context(`::jsprint`)
  * Walk the references backwards to find the root object(`::findjsobjects -r`)
* Netflix uses universal JavaScript. The code requiring modules(possbily client-side modules) is wrapped in a `try-catch` block, and whenever the code throws, the required module metadata is leaked. So each request brough a few leaks - disaster

### [Node.js in Flames](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/11/nodejs-in-flames.html)

* Express put all the route handlers in a global array, so each lookup takes O(n)
* They have some code periodically adding routes to the app, increse the size of the global array by 10 per hour
* After some time, the lookup became very costly, burning out the CPU
