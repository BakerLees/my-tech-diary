## VR

### [RiftSketch: Live coding in VR with the Oculus Rift, Firefox WebVR, JavaScript and Three.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db-7J5OaSag)

This looks amazing...and it's from two years ago...

### [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/guide/)

Build the VR scene **declaratively**

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My first VR site</title>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/latest/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-cube></a-cube>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

Reminds me of [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) and [X3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3D), although they are much more low-level:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE X3D PUBLIC "ISO//Web3D//DTD X3D 3.3//EN"
  "http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-3.3.dtd">
<X3D profile='Immersive' version='3.3'
  xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
  xsd:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-3.3.xsd'>
 <head>
  <meta content='http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/HelloWorld.x3d' name='reference'/>
  <meta content='http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/HelloWorld.html' name='reference'/>
 </head>
 <Scene>
  <Shape>
   <Text string='"Hello" "world!"'>
    <FontStyle justify='"MIDDLE" "MIDDLE"'/>
   </Text>
   <Appearance>
    <Material diffuseColor='0.1 0.5 1'/>
   </Appearance>
  </Shape>
 </Scene>
</X3D>
```

The best part about these markup languages is that they are really ituitive, just like HTML/SVG. You can modify the code without too much digging into the doc, and can pick them up in a few minutes then start to build stuff.
