## Self: the power of simplicity

### Highlight

* Prototypes combine inheritance and instantiation
* Slots unite variables and procedures
* Does not distinguish state from behavior
* Objects access their state information by sending messages to `self`

### Principles

* **Messages-at-the-bottom**
  * No variables
  * Slots are accessed via **message passing**, so MP is more fundamental
* **Occam's razor**
  * No classes, no variables
  * No difference between variable access and message passing
  * No control structures, just closures and polymorphism
  * Representing procedures as prototypes of activation records
  * Procedures store variables and environment the same way as objects
* **Concreteness**
  * Portotypes and cloning

### Prototypes

* A SELF object contains **named slots** which may store state or behavior
* When receiving a message for a slot it doesn't have, lookup via `parent` pointer

### Prototypes v.s. Classes

* **Simpler relationships**
  * instantiation + subclass -> inheritance
  * Challenge: how to organize the program without classes
* **Creation by copying**
  * Simpler metaphor than instantiation
  * Send the message `clone` to the prototypical object, instead of sending `new` to a class
* **Examples of preexisting modules**
  * Prototypes are **examples** of objects rather than **descriptions** of format and initialization
  * It's more concrete and more easier to understand than classes
* **Support for one-of-a-kind objects**
  * Classes are designed to support multiple instances, they have no linguistic support for defining behaviors unique to and object, and can be quite awkward to create a singleton
  * Prototypes natually support uniqueness of objects
* **Elimination of meta-regress**
  * There is no crazy meta-classes for unification. Everything is a object, there's nothing more to unify
* To avoid the situation where changing the prototype would affect the whole hierarchy, every prototype will have their shared behavior put into another object, and we make this object the parent of everything, including the prototype

#### Blending State and Behavior

* Access and change variables via message passing to itself. `self` can be implicit to make it less verbose.
* Express active variables and daemons(getters and setters). Variables can be stored or be accessed via special methods(replacing data slots with code)
* To share the state you can just make two objects and let them inherit from another object containing the shared state
* **Disadvantages of variables**
  * Languages usually separate variable access and message passing, so **messages are less powerful** because assignment and access aren't part of their model
  * In Class-based languages, if a superclass  **directly accesses** its variables, then a specialization (subclass) **cannot replace a variable with a computed result** anymore.
  * The classes restrict the format of objects, which **makes inheritance less powerful**
  * Variable access requires **scoping rules**, yet a further complication

### Closures and Methods
