## C++

### [Trip report: Winter ISO C++ standards meeting](https://herbsutter.com/2016/03/11/trip-report-winter-iso-c-standards-meeting/)

#### Stuff that made it into C++ 17

* [The Parallelism TS](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P0024R2.html): Parallel STL.
  * Parallelized versions of STL
  * Opt in on multiple cores and/or on multiple vector lanes
  * Execution policies, new functional operators
* [Library Fundamentals 1 TS](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/p0220r1.html): New libraries
  * `any`, `optional`, `string_view`, `shared_ptr` for arrays
  * Polymorphic allocators and memory resources(memory pools)
  * `search` and sampling algorithms
  * `apply`
* [File System TS](http://isocpp.org/files/papers/P0218r1.html)
  * Portable handling of files, paths, symlinks, .etc.
  * `<filesystem>`, `std::filesystem::path`, `std::filesystem::file_status` and stuff
* [Mathematical Special Functions IS](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P0226R1.pdf): addtions to `<cmath>`
  * Polynomials, elliptic integrals, Bessel functions, zeta function, beta function, .etc.

#### Stuff that made it into C++17 and made it fast

* `constexpr` can include lambdas and closures...so...now compiler frontends REALLY have to include some kind of mini intepreters... o.O
* Lambdas can capture `[*this]`
* Range-for loop can have different begin and end types
* `[[fallthrough]]`(falling through without it will give warnings), `[[nodiscard]]`(annotate that return values matter), `[[maybe_unused]]`(annotate intentionally unused variables/parameters)

#### Stuff that could make it in June

* `constexpr if`
* Template parameter deduction for constructors, a lot of "make" helpers could be gone when this comes
* Defining the order of expression evaluation
* Overload `.`
* Default comparisons, generate `!=` and others automatically

#### Stuff that won't make it this round, but might later

* Ranges, Networking, Library Fundamentals 2, and Parallelism 2
* Modules(oh...)
* Coroutines
* Concurrency 2
* 2D Graphics
* contracts
* reflection

#### Concept

* TS published less than a year ago
* Will be shipped in GCC 6.0
* Almost everyone who spoke loved it
* But not everyone agrees that it should be in C++17. It's too important.

#### Modules

* Macros are getting in the way of consensus
* Vendors are waiting for the first working draft

#### C++0x to C++1x

* Focus on *when* instead of *what*. That way we don't have to wait until all features we want to include in the next standard are ready(which is why C++11 took so long to release). We just release the snapshot when the time comes, whether all the features on our wish list are ready or not.
* This new model is suprisingly similar to what the ECMAScript have chosen...and ECMAScript also had a long-overdue big release(ES6 v.s. C++11)
* They are thinking about change the process from 3-year cycles to 2-year cycles

## Idea

Make a gantt chart that shows the states of ECMAScript versions and proposals
