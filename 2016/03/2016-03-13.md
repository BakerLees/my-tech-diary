### [React 2014 : Erik Meijer - What does it mean to be Reactive?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTSQlYX5DU0)

* Objects (with their getters and setters) are full of side effects

#### The getters

* Are like **lazy producers**.
* They are **covariant** in that for a type A with its getter typed `() => A`, the subtype B has type `() => B` which is also `() => A`(getter of B is a subtype of getter of A)
  * `A <: B` then `() => A <: () => B`
* They are **functors**
  * `def map(A => B) => (() => A)) => (() => B)`
  * `map f a = () => f(a())`
  * You can map a getter `() => A` over a function typed `A => B`, then it produces `() => B`
* They can throw exceptions -> have side effects, or just terminates normally(important!)
  * `() => Try[Option[A]]`

#### Getter of getters

* There are getter of getters `(() => Try[Option[A]])`, and they should never fail
* The interface

  ```
  trait Enumerable[+T] {
    def getEnumerator(): Enumerator[+T]
  }

  trait Enumerator[+T] {
    def moveNext(): Boolean  // consumer is in charge
    def current: T
  }
  ```
* *In Java and Scala, the types are wrong*(one *trait*, two functions)
* They are functors too

  ```
  def map: (A => B) => Enumerable[A] => Enumerable[B]
  map f as = as.lift(_.map)
  ```

#### Setters

* `A => ()` are like *lazy consumers*. The producers are in charge
* They are **contravariant**
  * The setter of A, is a subtype of the setter of B, which is a subtype of A(the arrows are reversed!)
  * `A <: B`
  * `B => () <: A => ()`
* They are **coFunctors**
  * `val map: (A => B) => ((B => ()) => (A => ())`
  * `map f b = a => (b(f a))`
  * You can map a setter of B over a function typed `A => B`
* They can accept exceptions, or be notified to terminate(important!)
 * `Try[Option[A]] => ()`
* The interface

  ```
  trait Observable[+T] {
    def subscribe(o: Observer[T]): ()
  }

  trait Observer[-T] {
    def onCompleted(): ()  // producer is in charge
    def onError(error: Throwable): ()
    def onNext(value: T): ()  // you can only react to it
  }
  ```

#### Setter of setters

* Type

  ```
  (Try[Option[A]] => ()) => ()
  ```
* They are functions(**covariant again**!)

  ```
  def map: (A => B) => Observable[A] => Observable[B]
  map f as = as.lift(_.map)
  ```

#### Implementations

* `Iterables[+T]`
  * `BufferedIterator[+A]`, `IndexedSeq[+A]`, `Seq[+A]`, `LinearSeq[+A]`, `Set[A]`, `Map[A, +B]`, `SortedMap[A, +B]`, `SortedSet[A]`
  * You need additional functionalities(e.g. indexibility), so you need these concrete implementations
* `Observables[+T]`
  * `GregYoungEventStore[+A]`(indexable array of events, indexed by time), `SignalR`, `Events`, `FireBase`(reactive database), `StreamSQL`, `Subject[S, T]`, `Tx`, `Splunk`

#### Latency

* Future is the thing that **guards you agains the effect of latency**
* LOL he says "Future is a monad that describes an effect"
* Now we have `() => Future[Try[Option[A]]]` and `Try[Option[A]] => Future[()]`(notice the future is on the right side), all effects are explicit
* In Scala the type quickly becomes very complicated, but in the weakly typed languages this is much more simpler
* Futures should be handled by async/await
* We should not be religious, it's OK, if not better, to mix things
