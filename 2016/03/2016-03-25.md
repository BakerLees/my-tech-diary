## JavaScript Engine

### [[esnext] implement String padding proposal](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/1a272ba23ec490f73349201c014537c851f3c964)

LOL!

* It also uses the exponentiation by squaring(with bitwise operations), and it's implemented in self-hosted JS.

### Why string addition is fast in V8

#### Ref

* [When would you use .concat() in javascript](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25635266/when-would-you-use-concat-in-javascript)
* [simple and incomplete explanation of V8 strings](https://gist.github.com/mraleph/3397008)

#### Notes

* Basically, V8 uses cons string(which is some kind of [rope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure))) as the underlying data structure for results of string concateneation. It's a tree-like structure, as long as you don't index into it, it's pretty fast. When you do index into it, V8 will flatten it. Luckily, people rarely index into strings.
*ã€€When you use string addition, V8 will patch the piecies into a new cons string, which is pretty efficent(it's like, O(1) or something).
* When you use `string.prototype.concat`, V8 will write them into a flat string, which is considerably slower(O(N), boom!).
* When you use `Array.prototype.join`, things are even worse...you will have an array, and you need to allocate memory for the new string, yikes.
