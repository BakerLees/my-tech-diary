## DB

I need a recap on this...almost forgot what I've learned in the DB course

* Database normalization is the process of organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to minimize data redundancy.
* The normal forms are guidlines to help you normalize your database

### To design a database

1. Indentify entities and relationships in your domain
2. Draw an E-R diagram
3. Classify relationships to form the tables
  * 1:1 : in the same table
  * 1:N : separate table with foreign keys
  * N:N : two entity tables and a junction table with a composite key
4. Normalize your design, usually to 2/3NF
  * There is usually trade-off between redundancy and performance(table joins are very expensive), so don't be too crazy about this

### 1NF

#### Related data should have primary keys

* Violation: no primary keys - even compound primary keys
* Another word: the records can't be uniquely identified by at most all of its fields
* Solution: check again if you have addtional fields missing, or use a **surrogate key** by creating an auto-increment id

#### How the records are ordered in the table doesn't matter

* Violation: the order of records matters
* Common case: missing a date or time field
* Solution: add another field for it(e.g. create time)

#### Fields should not be duplicated

* Violation: in some fields the values are like arrays, or some fields are the same type of thing
* Example

  | id | name | car1   | car2   | car3   |
  |----|------|--------|--------|--------|
  | 1  | Tom  | modelA | modelB | modelC |
  | 2  | Cat  | modelB | NULL   | NULL   |

  or

  | id | name | cars                   |
  |----|------|------------------------|
  | 1  | Tom  | modelA, modelB, modelC |
  | 2  | Cat  | modelB                 |
* Solution: put the duplicated fields into another table, let them reference records in the original table

### 2NF

#### Non-prime attributes should depend on the primary keys

* Violation: some non-key fields don't depend on /can't be uniquely defined by/can't be derived from the primary keys. They have no conceptual dependency whatsoever.
* Another word: any set of none-key fields should vary beween records with different key fields(this should at least be reaonable if not yet shown in the data). Be careful if you see a set of data duplicated over multiple records
* Example

  | id | model  | price  | store | country |
  |----|--------|--------|-------|---------|
  | 1  | modelA |  100   |   SA  |   USA   |
  | 2  | modelC |  200   |   SB  |   UK    |
  | 3  | modelD |  300   |   SB  |   UK    |
* Solution: put the fields with redundency into another table(e.g. move store and country into a Store table in the example above), and let the original table reference records in it
* Note: there might be more than one way to do it
* Note: if you find yourself frequently list all unique values in a field, you might need to extract it into another table too

### 3NF

#### All fields should depend and only depend on the primary key

* Violation: there are some fields depends on/can be uniquely defined by/can be derived from another but the later are not included in the primary key
* Another word: some fields **can be derived** from another non-key fields
* Example: obviously the city depend on (can be uniquely identified by/can be derived from) poscode

  | id | name | city  | poscode |
  |----|------|-------|---------|
  | 1  | Tom  | cityA |  61311  |
  | 2  | Cat  | cityB |  14225  |
  | 3  | Bob  | cityC |  33145  |
* Solution: put these fields into another table and let the original table reference them
* Note: 2NF and 3NF are somewhat related, but the primary keys in the table extracted to comply to 3NF are also in the original table, while those for 2NF might not be(e.g. needs another id)
