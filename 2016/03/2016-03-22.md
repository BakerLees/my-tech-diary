## FP

## History

* 1930s: Alonzo Church, lambda calculus
* 1950s: John McCarthy, Lisp, retaining variable assignments
* 1960s: Peter Ladin, ISWIM, the first pure FP langauge, based strongly on the lambda calculus, with no assignments
  * Christopher Strachey and Dana Scott developed denotational semantics to describe programs with mathmetical denotations
  * DSL was born
  * [The Next 700 Programming Languages](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Landin66.pdf)
  * First introduced the [off-side rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule), where blocks are expressed via indentation. Haskell and Python are two languages that adopted this rule. The implementation of off-side rule requires states(the current level of indentation), and that's where later [monads kick in](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf)
* 1970s: John Backus, FP, emphasizes higher-order functions and reasoning about programs
  * Turing Award lecture: [Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style](worrydream.com/refs/Backus-CanProgrammingBeLiberated.pdf)
  * Introduced method chaining(adopted by LINQ, F#, .etc.), which makes wirting variable-free code much easier
* 1970s: Robin Milner, ML, the first modern functional language, introduced type inference and polymorphic types(generics)
  * The idea of scripting language
  * Strict, allow side effects
* 1970s: David Turner, SASL, KRC, Miranda
  * Lazy functional languages, pattern matching, guards
  * SASL, which was untyped, was compiled to SKI combinators
* 1990s: Phil Wadler, type classes and monads
* Types: [Static Typing Where Possible, Dynamic Typing When Needed: The End of the Cold War Between Programming Languages](Static Typing Where Possible, Dynamic Typing When Needed: The End of the Cold War Between Programming Languages)
