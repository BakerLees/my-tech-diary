## Testing

### [Are (database) integration tests bad?](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/301479/are-database-integration-tests-bad)

* Unit tests test stuff in a controlled environment, in isolation.
* Integration tests test stuff in a more realistic environment(possibly with external dependencies), to see if everything works together
* You can use a special database dedicated for testing, or using an in-memory database as some kind of mock
* Unit tests should be fast and run on the build machine(say, the developer's laptop). If they don't pass, the code should not be commited. It's associated with builds.
* Integration tests should be run in the real environment or a sandbox. It's associated with deployment.
* Unit tests don't catch all defects. They just don't. But they are cheaper to setup and run.

These are really enlightenling stuff...

> If it talks to the database, it is not a unit test.
If it communicates across the network, it is not a unit test.
If it touches the fi le system, it is not a unit test.
If it can’t run at the same time as any other unit tests, it is not a unit test.
If you have to do special things to your environment to run it, it is not a unit test

...

> But don’t get stuck on any dogma.
Write the test that needs to be written.


### [Test Pyramid](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html)

```
        /\                           --------------
       /  \        UI / End-to-End    \          /
      /----\                           \--------/
     /      \     Integration/System    \      /
    /--------\                           \----/
   /          \          Unit             \  /

  Pyramid (good)                   Ice cream cone (bad)
```

* End-to-end tests are easy to record and playback, but they can be broken very easily, expensive to write, and time consuming to run. This leads to the [non-determinism problems](http://martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html), then people stops trusting them.
* In a Web application, the top part are made using stuff like selenium. The middle part are more about APIs, which can be made using fake HTTP requests, and the bottom are written with frameworks suitable for the server-side code.

### [Just Say No to More End-to-End Tests](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html)

#### Problems with end-to-end tests

* End-to-end tests don't help to find where the bug is(it could be anywhere since the tests are in the blackbox)
* They are expensive to run. Any weird failure in the dependencies would break the testing environment
* They don't guarntee to produce the same result when applied to the same code

#### Unit tests

* They seems ideal
  * Fast
  * Reliable
  * Isolate failures
* Examples: [build](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/base/Stopwatch.java) and [test](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava-tests/test/com/google/common/base/StopwatchTest.java) a stopwatch
* But, when the units work well in isolation, you do not know if they work well together.

#### Integration tests

* It is a middle ground, verifying if units coherently work together

#### The test pyramid

* Google often suggests a **70/20/10 split**: 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, and 10% end-to-end tests.

So the testing pyramid thing is also present in building planes...

> To produce a working aircraft, Airbus had to systematically eliminate those risks using a process it calls a “testing pyramid.” The fat end of the pyramid represents the beginning, when everything is unknown. By testing materials, then components, then systems, then the aircraft as a whole, ever-greater levels of complexity can be tamed. “The idea is to answer the big questions early and the little questions later,”
