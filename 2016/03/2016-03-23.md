### [How one developer just broke Node, Babel and thousands of projects in 11 lines of JavaScript](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)

Don't think unpublishing all his modules is a good move...publishing new ones with a warning telling stories about those jerks could be better.

### [kik, left-pad, and npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm)

There are a lot of negative comments...well I think people are being too harsh on npm now. Their service to the most of the community is free, and they are hardly a giant coorperation that can afford to be sued for this by those patent lawyers, we should cut them some slack...

* Yeah it's pretty scary
* But hey, when you think about launchpad and PPAs, you can be convinced that the community is able to handle this(most of the times)
* Blockchain-based npm sounds cool
* And we definitely needs signatures for packages, geez

Oh yeah now I believe they are going to make it into ES2017.

* Don't forget the corner case of complex symbols
* Functions are broken down to small pieces, of course(easier to inline)
* Used [exponentiation by squaring algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring) for a fast repeat

Don't really think it's a good idea, but hey, give it five minutes.
