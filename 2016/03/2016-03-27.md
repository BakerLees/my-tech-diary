## [Microservices a definition of this new architectural term](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)

#### Decentralized Data Management

* Different systems might view the data in different ways e.g. different attributes, or common attributes with different semantics
* A solution: [Bounded Context](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html) in DDD(Domain-Driven Design)
* Services should have their own data store
* Using [Polyglot Persistence](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PolyglotPersistence.html): different data storage technologies for different kinds of data
* What about consistency & transactions?
  * Emphasize [transactionless coordination](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings/18_starbucks.html) between services
  * There are only **eventual consistencies**, acheived with **compensating operations**
  * Businesses usually handle some degree of inconsistency for faster responses anyway.

#### Infrastructure automation

* Continuous delivery & continuous integration
* The pipeline
  * **Compile, unit and functional test** on build machine
  * **Acceptance test** after being deployed on build machine
  * **Integration test** in integration environment
  * **User acceptance test** in UAT env
  * **Performance test** in performance env
  * Production
* Automated tests and automate deployment upon passing the tests
* Blue/Green deployment

#### Design for failure

* Clients shold be able to respond to failed services gracefully
* Neflix's [SimianArmy](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy)(Chaos Monkey)
* Phoenix Servers: The system should be able to **detect the failures** quickly and **automatically restore** services if possible
* **Monitor** your services

####ã€€Evolutionary Design

* Control changes, but not reduce changes
* Components should be devided with the notion of **independent replacement and upgradeability** at heart. Keep things that change at the same time in the same module.
* Example(replaceability): the Guardian website, build microservices using the monolith's API, develop new temporary features (e.g. SP pages) rapidly and discard them afterwards
* If you often find yourself changing two services together, maybe you should just merge them
* If you worry about changes to services might break the consumers, prefer designing the interfaces as tolerant as possible before you choose the path of versioning. [Only use versioning as a last resort](http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html#versioning)
