## JavaScript

### [TXJS 2011 A6 - Brendan Eich - Ecma TC39: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly](https://vimeo.com/27911873)

* History of `with`: someone requested to shorten `document.foo.bar`, and he just runshed into a bad implementation
* Good parts
  * Experts
  * Care & love for JS
  * Consensus-driven
* Bad parts
  * Compare stuff that in fact have no connection at all
  * Making deals
  * Care too much about complexity
  * Senario-solving without decomposition(E4X for example)
* Ugly parts
  * Meta-endless
* Walk through ES.next features
  * There used to be typed structs, private members, `@` for `this`, comprehensions...
  * Symbols used to be in a bulit-in module `require("@name")`

#### Q&A

* Why are modules static
  * The host can prefetch the dependency
  * Saves you the trouble of making a callback/continuation


### [A Technical Comparison of the Shift and SpiderMonkey AST Formats](http://engineering.shapesecurity.com/2015/01/a-technical-comparison-of-shift-and.html)

#### Improvements

* More inline with ES6
* Removed SpiderMonkey-specific extensions
* Split some productions to make it harder to produce an invalid AST(e.g. `TryStatement` -> `TryCatchStatement` + `TryFinallyStatement`, `SwitchStatement` -> `SwitchStatement` + `SwitchStatementWithDefault`), avoid conflicts (e.g. `MemberExpression` -> `StaticMemberExpression` + `ComputedMemberExpression`), and make them less overloaded
* More suitable for transformation

#### Extensions to ES5(part of ES6)

* `VariableDeclarationKind` contains `let` and `const`
* `FunctionDeclarations` in arbitrary `Statement` position

#### Addtional checks required for a valid AST

* Mostly concerns strict mode and labels
