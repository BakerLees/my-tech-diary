## [Microservices a definition of this new architectural term](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)

### Monoliths and microservices

* Monoliths are scaled horizontally with load balancer, each instance is a fully functional application.
  * Change cycles are tied together. Changing a small part of the application requires **the entier monolith to be rebuilt and deployed**
* Microservices are independently deployable and scalable, can be written in different languages, built by different teams

### Characteristics of microservices

#### Componentization via services

* Components
  * Independently replacable
  * Independently upgradable
* Libraries v.s. services
  * Libraries(communicate via languages) - monolith, the tech stack is coupled
  * Servies(communicate via inter-process communications) - microservices, can be managed independently
* Using services as components(rather than libraries)
  * Services can be independently deployed
  * Component interface are more explict
    * However romote calls are more expensive than in-process calls
* You can approximately map services to one or more processes that are always developed and deployed together

#### Organized around bussiness capabilities

Conway's Law:

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

* Do not organize by things like UI/Server/Data, organize by things like orders/sipping/catalog
* Teams are cross-functional
* Large monolithic applications can be modularized in this way too, but they just tend to be organized around **too many contexts** - and it would become difficlt for teams to fit these contexts into their short-term memory

#### Products not Projects

* People who build the product should also maintain the product
* The team should contact with their users, at least do some support work
* The team should focus on how to enhance the bussiness capability for their users

#### Smart endpoints and dumb pipes

* The opposite: Enterprise Service Bus(ESB) that includes complex facilities for message routing, choreography, transformation, bussiness rules applications
* The smartness should not be in middlewares, but in endpoints.
* Smart endpoints
  * Own their own domain logic
  * Act like Unix filters
  * Use a simple RESTish protocol to communicate with each other
* Hot resources can be cached easily
* Message buses should be lightweight, infrasturcture should be dumb(KISS)
* When convertiing monoliths to microservices, avoid chatty communications

#### Decentralized gonvernance

* Centrualized gonvernance leads to single technology platforms. But most of the time, no technology can be the silver bullet, you need **different solutions for different subproblems**
* Example: Netflix. Sharing useful and, above all, battle-tested code as libraries.
  * They tend to focus on problems like data storage, inter-process communication, infrasturcture automation, .etc.
