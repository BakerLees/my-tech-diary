## Node.js/RethinkDB & NASA

### [RethinkDB Case Study: NASA (EVA)](https://rethinkdb.com/blog/nasa-case-study/)

* EVA = Extra-Vehicular Activity, a.k.a. spacewalks.
* The contractor MRI builds group support systems
* Open source enterprise architecture in the AWS GovCloud
* Day-to-day business activities must proceed as normal and new applications should be built without interference. MRI build new applications with Node.js/RethinkDB while synchronizing data between RethinkDB and legacy database systems. This is based on **RethinkDB change events** and **recurring ETL services** from legacy systems.
* Real-time support

* Started from a failed spacewalk
* Not enough data
  * Data sources were coming from single-purpose monoliths built by different contractors
  * No integration, can't search comprehensively, massive duplication
* Solution
  * Distributed system, integration tier, open source tech
  * Elasticsearch for comprehensive search, migrate and OCR documents, REST APIs(Node), microservice platform, CI/CD pipelines, RethinkDB, docker containers
  * Framework for contractor/NASA intergration
