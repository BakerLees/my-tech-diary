### [Motion – Duration and easing](https://www.google.com/design/spec/motion/duration-easing.html#)

#### Duration

* Objects travelling longer distances should have longer durations
* Common durations
  * ~300ms. >400ms may feel too slow
  * Large, complex, full-screen transitions: ~375ms
  * Objects entering the screen: 225ms
  * Objects leaving the screen: 195ms
* Larger screens have longer durations
  * Tablets: 30% longer than mobile
  * Wearbles: 30% shorter than mobile
  * Desktop: faster and simpler(150ms ~ 200ms)

#### Easing Curves

* Standard curve
  * Growing and shrinking material, among other property changes
  * `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)`
* Deceleration curve (“Easing out”)
  * Objects entering the screen
  * `cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1)`
  * Can scale up either in size (to 100%) or opacity (to 100%) at the same time
* Acceleration curve (“Easing in”)
  * Objects leaving the screen
  * `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1)`
  * Can scale down in either size (to 0%) or opacity (to 0%) at the same time
* Sharp curve
  * Objects that may return to the screen at any time
  * `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 1)`

### [Motion – Choreography](https://www.google.com/design/spec/motion/choreography.html#)

#### Continuity

* While a surface is expanding, a significant number of elements should **remain visible during the transition**
* If multiple elements are shared, **keep the most important ones**(the title, header, icon, etc) visible. Avoid path-crossing by fading in those less important elements after the important ones arrive in place. (Path-crossing will create a messy scene without focus)
* If one element is shared, the one element that remains present should be the **focal point** of the transition, controlling all other eleements
* If no elements are shared, anchor all crossfading elements to the surfaces's **vertical movement**, and the surface **crops the content** within.
* Leave enough room for unloaded elements after transition, avoid user frustration when a **touch target jumps away**

#### Creation

* Associate newly created surfaces to the element or action that creates them, using **radial or rectangular expansions** from point of touch
* Multiple items appear with **staggering**, don't let them show up all at once
  * But don't wait too long either(each no more than 20ms apart)
  * There should be a clear and intuitive focal path, not a random/unnatural one(e.g. bottom to top when the point of touch is on the top)
* Elements created without point of touch/actions should use **a combination of fading, position, and scaling transformations**
  * But don't use too much of them, or it would be distracting

#### Radial reaction

* Use touch ripples
* Screen reactions occurring near the point of touch should occur sooner than reactions further away.

### [Movement](https://www.google.com/design/spec/motion/movement.html#)

#### Movement within screen bounds

On-screen movements should follow a natural, concave **arc** using the **standard curve**

Exception: if the starting and the ending point lie **along an axis**, do not arc.

#### Movement in and out of screen bounds

* Independent movement(does not affect the position of any other objects around it)
  * Objects **entering the screen**: deceleration curve(ease out), ~225ms for mobile
  * Objects **leaving the screen permanetly**: acceleration curve(ease in), ~195 for mobile
  * Objects **leaving the screen temporarily**(e.g. menu): sharp curve, ~300ms for mobile
* Relative movement(affect other elements): standard curve, ~300ms for mobile
