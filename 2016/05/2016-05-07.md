## Optimization

### [A cache miss is not a cache miss](http://larshagencpp.github.io/blog/2016/05/01/a-cache-miss-is-not-a-cache-miss)

* Cache miss are only evil when your CPU needs to wait for the data/instruction to execute. If you CPU can execute just fine while waiting for the data, it's no big deal.
* It's the wasted processor cycles that matters, not the cache miss. Cache miss is just a (potential) cause (among many others) of wasted processor cycles
* Not all cache misses are equal(in terms of the effect on latency of the whole iteration). Data dependency between the reads can be just as important.
