### [Anders Hejlsberg on Modern Compiler Construction](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Seth-Juarez/Anders-Hejlsberg-on-Modern-Compiler-Construction)

* C#(roslyn) uses the same compiler frontend for IDE support and building the code
* Instead of maintaining a database containing "correct" information, whenever the user types, rebuild the (spine of the) AST for that file, diff and patch it using the pieces of the old AST so it can be more efficient(kinda like virtual DOM)
* It's a pull-based model instead of push-based model. You are lazily building up the AST and the look-aside table, they are now **persistent data structures**. It's functional so you can throw away stuff when the user types in the middle of the process, and you can run it on other threads
