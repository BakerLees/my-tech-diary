I don't really care for the coding style..(one-space indentation is just sooo weird), and some snippets just feel like ancient C, but it's a really nice demostration of how a HTTP server works (e.g. reading and writing sockets as FDs, processing headers, serving static files, piping out CGI script outputs). To me the most interesting part is the CGI stuff(finding the corresponding executable, using pipes, .etc), and it shows how natural the multithreaded model is for stuff like PHP.
