### [Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W71BTkUbdqE)

* [Bazel](http://www.bazel.io/)
* After switching to a customized perforce, the number of automated commits grew rapidly
* People has personal workspaces that gets synced to the centrual repo. All code must be reviewed before commit(human and automated tooling), changes to directories must be approved by owners(if you are not one)
* Auto-rollback after widespread breakage

#### Tools and Systems

* **Piper**: the system that hosts the repo
  * Implemented on top of standard Google infra, replicated globally(10 data centers)
  * Caching and async operations to optimize latency
* **CitC**: Cloud-based storage backend and a local file system view
  * Diff local changes, navigate and edit files
  * No need to clone the whole codebase locally
  * Devs can change machines without loosing the state of their work
  * Writes are saved as CitC snapshots, can be recovered later, used by automated toolings
* **Critique**: Code review
* **CodeSearch**: code browsing, exploration, semantic search, cross reference, archeology
* **Tricorder**: static analysis of code surfaced in Critique and CodeSearch, suggest fixes(one click in Critique)
* **Presubmits**: customizable checks, testing, can block commit, provide data on test coverage and code quality back to Critique
* **TAP**: automated test infra, before and after commit, auto-rollback
* **Rosie**: large scale chane distribution and management(split large patch and test idependently, send to owners for code review)

#### Trunk-based development

* No significant branching for development - branches are mainly for releases
* People work at the head of the trunk, all changes are serial
* Releases are cut from a specific revision and patched with some cherry-picked changes
* When developing new features, the old and the new code exist in the codebase simultaneously and are controlled using conditional flags

#### Pros

* Unified versioning
  * No forking, no cross-repo merging, only one single source of truth
  * After refactoring and reorganization the entire history of the codebase is still intact and available
* Code sharing and reuse
* Simplified dependency management
  * Change to the dependency will triger rebuild for the dependent code
  * No diamond dependency problem, less techical debt(A depends on B and C, B and C depend on D, but later they depend on different versions of D, then it would be difficult to build A since you can't be sure which version of D should be used)
  * Not just API. At the binary level they just statically link everything
* Atomic changes
  * Can make large, backward incompatible changes easily
  * Large scale renaming
* Large scale refactoring, modernization
  * Can be centrually manged by specialists
  * e.g. migrate to C++11
  * Old APIs can be removed with confidence
  * Errors and design mistakes can be found and fixed across the entire codebase and coupled with new compiler warnings or presubmit checks
* Collaboration across teams, flexible team boundaries and ownership
  * The compiler team can view the entire codebase, do cleanups and improve the compilers
* Code visibility and clear tree structure for implicit team namespacing
* Monolithic codebase != monolithic software design

#### Cons

* Costs of developing tools at scale
* Codebase complexity
  * Too easy? to add dependencies
  * Less insentive to develop stable and well-thought-out APIs
  * Build breakage
  * Binary sizes
  * Costs for building, testing, maintenance
* Code health must be priority
  * API visibility, default to private
  * API deprecation
  * Cleanups and refactoring
