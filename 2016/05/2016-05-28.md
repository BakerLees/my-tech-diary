### [Introducing Blue Ocean: a new user experience for Jenkins](https://jenkins.io//blog/2016/05/26/introducing-blue-ocean/)

I like this design...been working on a new workflow design lately, could take a few lessons from it.

## Reread CSAPP

* Floating-point arithmetic is not associative,
due to the finite precision of the representation
* The C compiler keeps the type information of pointers, but the generated code knows nothing about the data types
* Don't use `int` to store a pointer. It might be OK on 32-bit machines, but you'll have problems on 64-bit machines
* When reading numbers in machine-level code generated for little-endian machines, you need to reverse the order of each byte
* When printing data byte by byte, on little-endian machines you will see the least significant byte printed out first
* Linux 64 uses 8-byte addresses
* The ASCII code for decimal digit x happens to be 0x3x
* Encoding sets by bit vectors and do logical operations on them
* In C, unsigned data has logical right shifts(filled with 0), but signed data right shifts can be either logical or arithmetic(filled with the MSB). (Left shifts always fill 0)
* When shifting a w-bit number by k where k > w, the C standard gives no specification about what should be done. On many machines they effectively shift `k mod w`
