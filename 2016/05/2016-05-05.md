### [V8: Handles and Garbage Collection](https://developers.google.com/v8/embed#handles-and-garbage-collection)

* Since V8's GC will move objects around, you will need this to abstract the reference to a JS object. V8 is responsible to update the handles during GC
* Types of handles
  * `Local<T>`: held on stack, deleted by destructors. Lifetime is determined by a **handle scope**(usually go with a function call)
    * Will be GC'ed along with he scope.
    * The handle stack is not part of the C++ call stack, but the handle scopes are embedded in the C++ call stack
    * Handle scope must be stack-allocated, can't be `new`ed.
  * `Persistent<T>`: heap-allocated JS object, can outlive function calls. Lifetime might not correspond to C++ scopes(e.g. DOM nodes).
    * Can be weak(`PersistentBase::SetWeak`)
    * `Persistent<T>` can be constructed with constructors, but must be explicitly cleared with `Persistent::Reset`
    * `UniquePersistent<T>` uses constructors and destructors to manage its lifetime
    * Both `Persistent<T>` and `UniquePersistent<T>` can't be copied, so they can't be put into pre-C++11 STL containers(C++11 can use move semantics so it's not a problem there). The substitutes are `PersistentValueMap` and `PersistentValueVector`.
  * `Eternal`: persistent, expected to never be deleted, not managed by GC
* To return a local handle, don't put it in a `HandleScope`, instead put it in a `EscapableHandleScope`, call the `Escape` method with the handle you want to return.

### Example

Local and persistent handles:

```cpp
void run(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  // get the isolate
  v8::Isolate* isolate = v8::Isolate::GetCurrent();

  // create a handle scope to hold our local handles
  // note that it's stack allocated and embedded in the C++ stack
  HandleScope handle_scope(isolate);

  // create a local context, note that it returns a local handle
  Local<Context> context = Context::New(isolate);

  // we then create a persistent context based on that local context
  Persistent<Context> persistent_context(isolate, context);

  // create a scope i.e. enter this context
  Context::Scope context_scope(context);

  // these are all local handles and allocated on the heap, managed by GC
  Local<String> source_obj = String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, argv[1]);
  Local<Script> script_obj = Script::Compile(source_obj);
  Local<Value> local_result = script_obj->Run();

  // now the `handle_scope` goes out of the C++ scope
  // its destructor will be called, and objects referenced
  // by handles in it will be removed in the next GC
  // and so do source_obj, script_obj, local_result

  // But the context won't be deallocated since
  // it's persistent, and must be removed by
  // calling `persistent_context::Reset()`
  // if you don't call it, it will be leaked
}
```

Returning a local handle:

```cpp
// This function returns a new array with three elements, x, y, and z.
Local<Array> NewPointArray(int x, int y, int z) {
  v8::Isolate* isolate = v8::Isolate::GetCurrent();

  // We will be creating temporary handles so we use a handle scope.
  EscapableHandleScope handle_scope(isolate);

  // Create a new empty array.
  Local<Array> array = Array::New(isolate, 3);

  // Return an empty result if there was an error creating the array.
  if (array.IsEmpty())
    return Local<Array>();

  // Fill out the values
  array->Set(0, Integer::New(isolate, x));
  array->Set(1, Integer::New(isolate, y));
  array->Set(2, Integer::New(isolate, z));

  // Return the value through Escape.
  return handle_scope.Escape(array);
}
```
