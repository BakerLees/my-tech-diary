## V8

### [V8 Context](https://developers.google.com/v8/embed#contexts)

* Contexts are **execution environments**
* You must **explicitly specify** the context where your code will be run
  * So monkey patching builtins in one environment won't affect another
* V8 **caches** the builtins, so the first context created might be expensive, but subsequent contexts will be much cheaper
* V8 snapshots can deserialize a serialized heap  with compiled builtins to create the first context quickly
* You can switch between contexts. Enter a context by creating scopes: calling `Context::Scope scope(context)`

### [V8 Templates](https://developers.google.com/v8/embed#templates)

* A template is a blueprint for JavaScript functions and objects in a context
* You can use it to **wrap C++ functions and data structures** within JS objects and expose them to the JS code
  * e.g. DOM nodes, global functions
* You can reuse templates in different contexts, but you can only have **one instance** each in a given context
* **Function templates**
  * Blueprint for a function
  * You can **instantiate a JS function** by calling `GetFunction` within a context
  * You can **associate a C++ callback**
* **Object templates**
  * Each function template has an associated object template(used to configure objects constructed by this funciton)
  * Two C++ callbacks: accessor callbacks and interceptor callbacks

Example:

```cpp
// Create a template for the global object and set the
// built-in global functions.
Local<ObjectTemplate> global = ObjectTemplate::New(isolate);
global->Set(String::NewFromUtf8(isolate, "log"), FunctionTemplate::New(isolate, LogCallback));

// Each processor gets its own context so different processors
// do not affect each other.
Persistent<Context> context = Context::New(isolate, NULL, global);
```
