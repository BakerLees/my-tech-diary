### Node Live Beijing

Met pmq and mikeal today, along with Lucy from the Node foundation, and a guy(Chris?) from the VSCode team. Seems the foundation is pretty interested in Alibaba.

[Gave a talk about V8 GC](https://github.com/joyeecheung/v8-gc-talk). There was a bug in the talk and no one pointed out.(o.0) Later I realized how terribly wrong I am about a term in the talk, although I know the fact about it all along. Next time, I need to do the fact-check more carefully on my own...

M$'s building on the danling street is pretty nice. I stayed at a Holiday Inn and it's rather nice too(no bathtub though).
