### SRE CH2

#### Software

* Every server has an HTTP server providing diagnostics and statistics
* Services uses the RPC infrastructure **Stubby**(open sourced version: [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)) to communicate. Even calls to a local program will go through the RPC, which makes them easier to refactor into different servers later
* **GSLB** load balance RPCs
* Serialization and deserialization is done using **protocol buffers**.

#### Development

* Single shared repo
* People can submit CL to other people's projects
* Changes must be reviewed before being submitted
* Parallel compilation in the cloud, continuous testing

#### Requests

* Google DNS server -> GLSB picks the server IP
* GFE(reverse proxy) handles HTTP requests to the IP, find the frontend server using GSLB, then sends the request to the frontend server using RPC
* The frontend server uses protobuf to get results from the backend server(using GSLB to pick a server), and sends HTML back
* The backend server contacts a Bigtable server to get the data

#### Jobs

* N + 2 redundancy(one for update, one for failover)
* Regions with less traffic can reduce the redundancy to N + 1
* Replicate bigtables for locality
