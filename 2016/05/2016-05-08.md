## SRE

* It's easier to expand a structure later on than to introduce one that is not present later(really?)
* SRE can be viewed as a specific implementation of DevOps with some idiosyncratic extensions

#### CH1

* Ensuring a Durable Focus on Engineering
  * SRE is responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and cpacity planning for the services
  * Google caps operational work for SREs at 50% of their time, the rest of the time will be spent on engineering. That's why they are engineers.
* Pursuing Maximum Change Velocity Without Violating a Serviceâ€™s SLO
  * 100% is not the right reliability target
  * Google uses **error budget**: 1 - the availability target
  * Ideally we should spend all the budget on launching things quickly
  * Outage is no longer a bad thing, it is now expected, managed by both the SRE team and the development team
* Monitoring
  * Software should do the interpreting, and humans should be notified **only when they need to take action**
  * We have alerts, tickets, and logging
* Emergency Response
  * Reliability is a function of mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to repair (MTTR)
  * Use automatic "playbook" to improve MTTR
* Change Management
  * Roughly 70% of outages are due to changes in a live system
  * Remove humans from the loop
  * We need:
    * Progressive rollouts
    * Quickly and accurately detecting problems
    * Rolling back chnages safely when problems arise
* Demand Forecasting and Capacity Planning
  * Take organic growth(natrual adoption) and inorganic growth(feature launches, marketing campaigns, .etc)
  * Regular load testing for correlating raw capacity(servers, disks, .etc) to service capacity
* Provisioning
  * Combines both change management and capacity planning
  * Must be done quickly and only when necessary
* Efficiency and Performance
  * Resource use is a function of demand (load), capacity, and software efficiency
  * SREs predict demand, provision capacity, and can modify the software
  *  SREs provision to meet a capacity target **at a specific response speed**
