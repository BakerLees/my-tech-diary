This looks awesome!

### [State-Based Scripting in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves](http://www.slideshare.net/naughty_dog/statebased-scripting-in-uncharted-2-among-thieves)

Super fun!

* PLT Scheme(Racket)
  * Easy to parse, code as data, macro/DSL
* State scripts extends entities(*director* that orchestrates actions of other entities)
  * Attributes + states
  * Behavior via script code
    * Response to events
    * Natural behavior over time(update event)
    * Transitional actions between states
* Instantiation
  1. Attached to a native C++ game object
  2. Attached to a trigger region(convex volume detecting enter, exit, occupancy)
  3. Placed as a stand-alone object
  4. Associated with a task i.e. checkpoint(orchestrates AI encounters, controls player obejctives)
  5. Spawned by another script
* Object Model
  * Unreal: single root(`Actor`) class hierarchy, use UnrealScript to define classes(.uc), then generate C++ headers, implemented in C++/US
  * Property-centric/Componentized: UID + decorated with properties(encapsulates data & behavior)
  * Uncharted: single-root hierarchy(`Process`)
    * `Process`: objects that updates over time
    * `ProcessGameObject`: objects with transform and mesh
    * `Character`: base class for all characters
    * `SimpleEntity`: simple animating obejct
* The language
  * `go` and labels
  * Magic UID `"self"`
  * **Tracks**(bit like thread/fiber) can wait for duration/action, synchronized via signals
  * Mutable variables
