## WebCL

### Implementations

* Nokia's WebCL for Firefox(Windows/Linux 32bit)
* Samsungâ€™s WebCL for Safari (OSX)
* Intel RiverTrail (Windows/OSX 32/64)


### [WebGL, WebCL, MultiCores: The State and Future of Parallel Javascript in the Browser with RiverTrail](http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/11/webgl-webcl-multicore-rivertrail)

* Probably a precursor of SIMD.js
* A FF plugin developed by Intel to utilize multi-core, many-core, and machines with vector instructions
* Use `ParallelArray` and provide functions written in a subset of JS to stuff like `combine`, `map`, `reduce`, `filter`...
* These functions will be compiled to OpenCL, though they are just one of many possible alternatives(so no  lower level OpenCL features like local shared memory, synchronization barriers or workgroups)
* Advantages: easy-of-use, safety, availablity
* Not implemented in the JS engine, but on top of that

### [What about the GPU? - WebAssembly/design](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/273)

* Way beyond MVP
* Keep up with HSA, SPIR-V, RISC-V, particularly the progress done by LLVM
* SIMD might be a dead end
* Rely on vendors' effort

### [[WebCL] add openCL in gecko](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664147#c30)

Looks like they think `ARB_compute_shader`(in OpenGL ES 3.1) is more promising(well, WebGL 2/ES 3.0 is still on the way)
