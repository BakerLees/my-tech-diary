### [Stage left: Enter Goliath](http://everburning.com/news/stage-left-enter-goliath.html)

* Uses EventMachine and EM-Synchrony
* Convention, convention, convention
* Rack-aware
* ` goliath/test_helper` with `with_api` and `get_request` for testing
* The RACK middleware is built into the API class itself.
* Create an API server by subclassing `Goliath::API` and define the `response(env)` method
* `env` will contain
  * Configurations(directly on the `env`)
  * Request path(`env[Goliath::Request::REQUEST_PATH]`)
  * Methods(`env[Goliath::Request::REQUEST_METHOD]`)
  * Paramters(`env.params`)
* You can define `on_headers(env, headers)` to access the headers when they are available
* Goliath comes with built in logging capabilities(`env.logger`, based on `Log4r`)
* Access the request body via `env[Goliath::Request::RACK_INPUT].read`
* You can use `environment([:test, :development])` to run code only in test or dev environment
* You can use `EM.next_tick` to prevent your code from blocking. Remeber to store the references though.
* The code is [here](https://gist.github.com/dj2/7c2fe52d73fb290690cf)
