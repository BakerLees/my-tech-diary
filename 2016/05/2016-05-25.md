### [libco](http://byuu.org/library/libco/)

#### Structure

* -test:
  * `cc.bat`/`cc.sh`: build scripts. Use gcc to build `libco.o`, g++ to build tests(written in c++, which will be `-test/test_timing`), with flag `-fomit-frame-pointer`(to avoid the overhead of maintaining a frame pointer? After all we need to jump around anyways. Check [this](http://yosefk.com/blog/getting-the-call-stack-without-a-frame-pointer.html) out)
  * `test.h`: include `libco.h` and other C headers
  * `test_args.cpp`: entry points of cothreads can't have parameters because it's hard to make it portable. Instead we can use a global variable and let a overloaded `co_switch` set it properly. This also eliminates race conditions. This file is a test for such usage.
  * `test_timing.cpp`: see how long will it take to call X subroutines(t1), then see how long will it take to call 2X `co_switch`(t2), and checkout the skew t2/t1.
* Implementations
  * `amd64.c`: x64 implementation
  * `arm.c`: ARM implementation
  * `fiber.c`: only works on Windows
  * `ppc.c`: 32/64 PowerPC implementation
  * `sjlj.c`: designed for UNIX systems, uses `setjump`/`longjump` and hacks `jmb_buf` stack pointer, based on the paper [Portable Multithreading The Signal Stack Trick For User-Space Thread Creation by Ralf S. Engelschal](http://xmailserver.org/rse-pmt.pdf)
  * `ucontext.c`: super-high overhead, for POSIX systems with ucontext
  * `x86.c`: x86 implementation
* The interface
  * `libco.h`

    ```c
    typedef void* cothread_t;
    cothread_t co_active();
    cothread_t co_create(unsigned int, void (*)(void));
    void co_delete(cothread_t);
    void co_switch(cothread_t);
    ```
  * `libco.c`: choose different implementations for different platforms/compilers
