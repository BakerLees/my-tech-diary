### [V8, modern JavaScript, and beyond - Google I/O 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1swY14jiKc)

#### Tests

* 2007 - 2012: microbenchmarks like SunSpider, etc.
  * Useful for finding regressions, but not representative
* 2012 - present: static test suites like Octane, Speedometer, Jet Stream
  * More reflective on real applications
* Future: real web pages
  * Instrument popular web pages for measurement
  * Optimize most commonly used builtins

#### Upgrade

* GC
  * Orinoco(mostly parallel & concurrent GC, less jank, higher throughput)
  * Idle time scheduling
  * ~100% GC pauses invisible on infinite scroll pages, ~50% memory reduced on long-runing pages
* Interpreter
  * Fast startup & low memory consumption
  * 5%~15% memory reduced
  * 3-tier now
* ES6 & ES7
  * Why
    * Polyfills & transpilers can't replicate all features
    * Less overhead
    * Easier debugging
    * Speed over time
* [V8 inspector](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/6792)
  * WTF I'm having the same bug now(didn't know moment takes timestamp in seconds OTZ)
