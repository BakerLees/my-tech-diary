> The human should always win and here is why.
>
> First the human writes the whole thing in a high level language.
> Second he profiles it to find the hot spots where it spends its time.
> Third he has the compiler produce assembly for those small sections of code.
> Fourth he hand tunes them looking for tiny improvements over the machine
generated code.
>
> The human wins because he can use the machine.

* After finding a hotspot
  1. Find a better algorithm
  2. Compile rather than interpret
  3. Enable and tweak optimization from the compiler
  4. Give the compiler hints about how to optimize
  5. Fallback to assembly

  In that order.
* Compiler-generated code might be better than what you'd have written, particularly on modern multi-pipelined architectures
* Common source of performance problems on modern architectures
  * Memory access
  * Cache-miss
  * TLB-miss
  * Page-faults
* How to inspect compiler-generated code
  * Check if they can be obviously enhanced by hand-coded assembly/tweaking compiler switches. Try to avoid starting from scratch
  * Use generated code as stubs to modify so you can be sure the interfaces are right
  * Track down bugs in the compiler
* Pratical cases of hand-coding assembly code:
  * Small code
  * libc independent
  * Code for embedded hardware where every byte counts e.g. [httpd in assembly](https://gist.github.com/DGivney/5917914)
