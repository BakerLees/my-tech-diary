### [Fibers & Cooperative Scheduling in Ruby](https://www.igvita.com/2009/05/13/fibers-cooperative-scheduling-in-ruby/)

* Continuations in Ruby 1.8 suffered from serious memory leak problems
* Ruby introduced Fibers in 1.9
* The scheduling is cooperative(rather than preemptive in the thread model, in which Ruby uses a fair scheduler) and is controlled by the programmer. So programmers can have more flexibility when utilizing CPU resources, without the need of locks
* You can interleaved execution scheduled via IO interrupts. No extra context switches, no locks.
* Fibers can only be resumed in the thread that created them. To better utilize your resources on multi-core systems, you need to run M(number of cores) threads and optimize the number of Fibers(N) in each thread(determined by the need of your applications)
* JRuby and Rubinius implement Poor Man's Fibers(each mapped to a native thread)
