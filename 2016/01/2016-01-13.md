### [CONVERSATION: What's the core differences between the observables/signals approach of Cycle.js and Elm vs React's pseudo FRP manually-triggered branch re-rendering approach?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3zr6i0/conversation_whats_the_core_differences_between/)

* Elm and Cycle are based on observable primitives taking a **first class approach** to dataflow
* React is only reactive when it comes to rendering
* Elm has only first-order Signals, Cycle which uses RxJS supports higher-order Observables
* In React, there are more explicit chores to be done
* React is in fact multiparadigm: **OOP** for components, **RP** for unidirectional dataflow, **FP** for "UI as a function of state"
* Reactive makes event dependencies explicit. This helps you to avoid hidden dependencies and race conditions
