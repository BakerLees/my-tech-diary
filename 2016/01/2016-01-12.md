## JavaScript Engine

### [Gaurav Seth & Steve Lucco - Inside Chakra - JSConf US 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en1VCmbI7Fc)

* Still confused about "Chakra powers Outlook.com"..He didn't mean Node, I think
* Part of the reason they announced the news at JSConf was that Node.js was announced in JSConf
* MIT lisence, at January
* The Candy Robot Demo is impressive...excited about TTD
  * Apparently it preserves the timestamp
* Mikeal: Node's story today, is looking more and more like the story of the Web

#### Performance

* The bailout relies on the OS API to do virtual unwind
  * Use stack walk to identify the caller
  * The OS API provides a lot of unnecessary data
* Solution: link JIT'ed functions with **RBP chains** so they can walk the stack faster
* Side notes: on x86 and x64 `%rbp` points at the previous stack frame, so it forms some kind of **linked list of stack frames**, which you can use to do the stack walking
  * Another note: it's not the only way e.g. GCC omits the frame pointer by default nowdays and store the info needed for unwinding in DWARF - but this costs space. When you can separate the release and the debug build, it's fine, and can free up one GPR while shorteninig the function prologue and epilogue, but for JS this is not the case.

* Cortana - always on, needs small memory footprint
  * Read the slides before
