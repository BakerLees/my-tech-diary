### [Lang.NEXT 2012 Expert Panel: Web and Cloud Programming (and more)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012/Panel-Web-and-Cloud-Programming)

> What happens when Anders Hejlsberg, Gilad Bracha, Martin Odersky, and Peter Alvaro get together for an interactive panel moderated by Erik Meijer?

* As a logic programmer you will be natually alerted to **monotonicity**(output grows with input/don't have to update conclusions) and cycle, so monotonic logic leads to pipelinable distributed systems
* In the right language, it's cheap and easy(even just a syntatic manner) to tell which code is monotonic(means cheap synchronization) and which code is nonmonotonic(must be guarded)
* It's too hard to keep shared state in imperative programs honest in a parallel system -> switch to functional programming
* Pure functional programming is a lie because you have global namespaces
* There's a new cross-platform player in town called JavaScript and the type system went out with the bathwater(LOL)
* "Are you implying that you can't write big programs in JavaScript or..?" "No, I think you can, but I don't think you can maintain them"
* If you filter a set, you should get a set. If you filter a sequence, you should get a sequence. Scala is the only statically typed language out there that provides this basic principle. Smalltalk provides it too but it's dynamically typed.
* The bang for the buck is not the guarantee provided by the types, it's the tooling enabled by the types, which provides productivity
* Types are good, but you always need an escape patch -- in statically typed languages, it's casting.
* For performance you'll always have to choose between compile-time invariance, or runtime dynamic type checks
