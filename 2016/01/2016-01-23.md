### [Hewitt, Meijer and Szyperski: The Actor Model (everything you wanted to know, but were afraid to ask)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Hewitt-Meijer-and-Szyperski-The-Actor-Model-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask)

#### Actor

* Processing: things to be done
* Storage
* Communication

#### Axioms: what an Actor can do

* Create more actors
* Send messages to actors that it has address
* Can designate what it's gonna do with the next message it receives

#### Continuation

* Continuation is an idea for single-thread, but actor has more to do with concurrency

#### Messages and Addresses

* Conceptually, an actor processes one message at a time, but the implementation can processes multiple messages(e.g. each time you handle the message in the same way)
* You won't have a deadlock by sending message to the actor itself, because the actor will get the **future** instead of blocking and waiting on it.
* Designating how the next message would be handled is different from creating another actor, because the target shouldn't be changed
* Addresses and actors have a many-to-many relationships(replicate/forward)
* You cannot tell how many actors there are in the system, they are not discoverable(note: address is not identity)
  * Bit like Google addresses
  * All you can do to an address is to send messages to it
