## Encryption

### [Time-based One-time Password Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)

* A form of HMAC, based on [HOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm), replace the incrementing counter with timestamps
* Secret key + current timestamp + cryptographic hash function
* The time of the clients and the server must be synchronized

#### [RFC 6238](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)

* Agreements
  * A generated key *K*
  * An epoch *T0*(defaults to the Unix epoch)
  * An interval *TI*(defaults to30s)
  * A crytographic hash method(defaults to SHA-1)
  * Token length *N*(defaults to 6)
* Generation
  * C = number of TIs elapsed after T0
  * H = hash(message=C, key=uint64(K))
  * O = least 4 significant bits of H
  * I = Form Obytes MSB at H, take 4 bytes, discard the MSB, store the rest as an uint32
  * Token = lowest N digits of I in base 10
    * If the results doesn't have enough digits, pad it with zeros from the left

## Devtools

### [DevTools: Throttle the CPU for a deeper understanding on page performance](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/88-cpu-throttling/)

Useful when you suspect your dev machine is too powerful to reproduce the performance problems LOL. It's currently only available in Canary though.
