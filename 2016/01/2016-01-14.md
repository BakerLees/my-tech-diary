## Electron

### Make a file picker

Checkout the [dialog documentation](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/dialog.md)

```javascript
const dialog = require('electron').dialog;
let chosenFiles = dialog.showOpenDialog({
  properties: ['openFile', 'openDirectory', 'multiSelections'],
  filters: [
    { name: 'Images', extensions: ['jpg', 'png', 'gif'] },
    { name: 'Movies', extensions: ['mkv', 'avi', 'mp4'] },
    { name: 'Custom File Type', extensions: ['as'] },
    { name: 'All Files', extensions: ['*'] }
  ]
})
```

Also, use `dialog.showSaveDialog()` combined with writing functions in `fs` to save the files.

## Node.js

### [Tips for Optimizing Slow Code in Node.js](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/tips-optimizing-slow-code-in-nodejs/)

* Use kernel-level tools e.g. DTrace, perf. XPerf
  * Kernel level profiling has the **minimal impact** on a running process
* V8 profiler
  * This shares the same process as the application so it could imapact the performance
  * Use `SIGUSR2` to toggle the profiling

#### How to make the choices

* For long-term profling, or if you don't want it to impact your appliaction, use kernel tools
* If you want to use Chrome devtools or trigger profiles on demand, use v8 profiler
* If you don't want to do the instrumentation yourself, use process managers
