### [Converting a large codebase to Hack](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Hack)

#### Language

* Statically typed
* Compatible with PHP but is neither subset nor superset(like TypeScript). The objects are interoperable with PHP objects and they have the same representation(on HHVM)
* Instantaneous type checking
* **Gradual typing** for incremental adoption
* Has **different modes**: strict, partial, decl

#### Tooling

* The IDE and the type checker is combined together
* The type-checker, which is also the front-end for HHVM, is a server

#### Conversion

* Can be rolled back
* The developers can always just bailout
* Automated conversion

#### Concerns from the developers

* Compilation is slow
  * Work harder
* The annotations is verbose
  * Infer types
* Bad error messages during compilation
  * Not just tell them what the problem is, but also tell they how to solve it
* Not flexible enough
  * Gradual typing

#### Rules

* The whole codebase is **strict** => the whole code base is **type-safe**
* Adding an annotation should never force you to add another
  * For developers to adopt it
* Removing an annotation should never introduce an error
  * So there is no overloading yet(no way to express the dispatching)
* Be "dumb" by default

#### Tighten the belt

* A global type-inference system to **"guess"** annotations
* A monitoring system to **detect mistakes**(warnings)
* Refactoring tools to remove or harden annotations

#### Cultural change

* Release easy, release often
* git rebase, keep close to the master

#### Lessons learned

* The process should be incremental. The developers should be able to choose when, how much of the code, and where of the code, should be upgraded.

#### Future

* [Nuclide](https://code.facebook.com/posts/397706937084869/building-nuclide-a-unified-developer-experience/)
  * It's based on the Atom editor...WOW...

#### Q&A

* Why do runtime checking
  * For JIT(hmmm...JS can't be this fortunate though)
* Collecting data for common mistakes and type errors, and improve the langauge based on this
