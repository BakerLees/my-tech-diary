### Building ChakraCore

1. Choose the right target(e.g. x64 and debug)
2. Fix the encoding(this is later merged in [this pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/pull/100), but when I was building it this was not merged yet)
3. Create a test:

  ```javascript
  WScript.Echo("Hello World");
  ```
4. Use the built binary(`ch.exe`) to run this script
5. To debug it, change the build target to ch, and set the breakpoints. Be sure to configure the command line argument so it takes an input.
