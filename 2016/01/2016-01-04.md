## Software Engineering

### [The Twelve-Factor Application](http://12factor.net/)

#### 1. One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

* Deploys: staging, production, etc.
* If there are multiple codebases, it’s not an app – it’s a distributed system
* Multiple apps sharing the same code is a violation of twelve-factor. You should put the shared code in a library that can be managed by a **dependency manager**

#### 2. Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

* Do not rely on implicit system-wide packages
* Declare all your dependencies, **completely and exactly, with a manifest**

#### 3. Store config in the environment

* Configs are likely to vary between deploys
  * e.g. Resource handles to DB, credentials, hostnames, etc.
* Storing config as constants in the code is a violation of the twelve-factor - **config should be strictly separated from the code**
* Storing config in a config file that won't be checked in to the revision controls is still not a good idea, because people can make mistakes, the files could be scattered, and be too language/framework-specific
* A simple check: can the codebase be **open sourced at any moment** without compromising any credentials?
* **Stores config in environment variables**
* Do not group the env-vars e.g. in `production`, `development`, because you might run out of group names when it scales up

#### 4. Treat backing services as attached resources

* The code for a twelve-factor app makes no distinction between local and third party services
* The backing services e.g. DB, caching system, mail server, messaging/queuing system, should be accessed via URL or info stored in the **config**.
* Changing the backing service should not trigger any modification to the code

#### 5. Strictly separate build and run stages

* The twelve-factor app uses strict separation between the **build, release, and run stages**. It should be impossible to change the code at runtime.
* **Build**: from codebase to executable, might fetch dependencies, compile binaries, etc.
* **Release**: combine build with config, resulting releases ready to be executed
* **Run**: run the app by launching processes
* Every release should always have a unique release ID. Releases can't be mutated. They can be rollbacked.
* Builds can be complex, and should be initiated when new code is deployed
* Run should be **simple and automatic**(e.g. when the server reboots, when the process crashes)

#### 6. Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

* Twelve-factor processes are **stateless and share-nothing**
* Any data that needs to persist must be stored in a stateful backing service e.g. a DB
* Never assumes that anything cached in memory or on disk will be available on a future request or job
* Sticky sessions are a violation of twelve-factor(requests from the same visitor to be routed to the **same process**). Use the backing services.


#### 7. Export services via port binding

* The twelve-factor app is **completely self-contained**
* Do not rely on runtime injection of a webserver
* In deployment, a routing layer handles routing requests **from a public-facing hostname to the port-bound web processes**.
* This happens in the user space -- in the app's code

#### 8. Scale out via the process model

* In the twelve-factor app, processes are a first class citizen.
* Follow the unix process model for **running service daemons**
* Assign each type of work to a process type
* Twelve-factor app processes should **never daemonize or write PID files**. Use tools for anything that requires you to do that.

#### 9. Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

* The processes should strive to minimize startup time, and shut down gracefully when they receive a SIGTERM signal.
* Steps to **graceful shutdown** in web services
  * Stop listening on the service port (thereby refusing any new requests)
  * Allow any current requests to finish
  * Then exit
* This indicates that HTTP requests are short
* For long-polling, the client should **seamlessly attempt to reconnect** when the connection is lost
* For worker processes, the current job should be **returned to the work queue/the locks on the job should be released**
* All jobs are reentrant
  * Wrap the results in **transaction**
  * Make the operation **idempotent**
* Processes should also be **robust against sudden death**

#### 10. Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

* Time gap: hours
* Personal gap: The one who write the code deploys the code
* Env gap: The dev and prod environments should be as similar as possible
* Do no rely on adaptors to use different backing services between development and production

#### 11. Treat logs as event streams

* A twelve-factor app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream
* The app just write its event stream, unbuffered, to `stdout`
* In developement env, the developer can view this stream
* In staging/production, the streams will be captured and merged by the environment, routed to another desitination for viewing and archival

#### 12. Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

* What are those processes
  * DB migration
  * Console, REPL
  * One-time scripts
* They should be run in the env where long-running processes run
* They should run against a release
* They must be **shipped with app code to avoid syncrhonization issues**
