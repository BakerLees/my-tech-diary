### [JavaScript Air Episode 007: Chakra, Microsoft's Open Source JavaScript Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WdFvLSEX8c)

* Scriptability v.s. Lua: fast & good libraries
* Differences between embedding V8 and embedding Chakra
  * No need for the smart pointer fuss. As long as you make sure your JS objects are on the stack(which will be walked) or allocated with the Chakra GC, you are safe.
  * FTR no need to learn Windows stuff either
* The linux version is built with Clang, so it will be entirely independent from the Windows tool chain
* The JS engine codebase was about 1/10 the size of the browser code base, so it was much easier to build a new JS engine only from scratch

#### Why use ChakraCore for Node.js?

* It has an interpreter, so you can stripped out the JIT stuff if you need to run this in a more resource-constraint env/somewhere you just can't do JIT/for a new instruction set
* The OSS model is gonna like the TypeScript project
* You can add more tooling to the ecosystem
* The server-side JS will have more say in the TC39
* It would be misleading to compare the JS engines compatibility issues with the Web compatibility issues -- the latter is FAR FAR FAR worse

#### Questions from Twitter

* The original codename is ...(the name of a french town, can't spell it)
* The name Chakra is made up by two executives(try to compete with SpiderMonkey :))
