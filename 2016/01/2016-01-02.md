### [How to fix a bug in an open-source project](http://nolanlawson.com/2015/12/28/how-to-fix-a-bug-in-an-open-source-project/)

1. Get the code
2. Run the tests
  * If the flow is unclear, try to make a PR to document your effort
3. Find a failing test
  * If you can reproduce the bug with existing tests, it's enough to make a PR about this -- so other people don't have to reproduce it again -- or at least comment in the issue
  * If you have to make new tests to reproduce the bug, you can
    * Try to break a test first(as a sanity check) e.g. change `assertTrue` to `assertFalse`
    * Make a new test based on an existing tests that's similar
4. Fix the bug
5. Open a PR
  * Most well-run open-source projects have automated tests that run on every commit, including pull requests.
  * Check that your code conforms to the project style
6. Wait for PR approval or feedback

> If a bug is impacting you personally, and youâ€™re the one who ran into it, then you are in the best position to fix it
