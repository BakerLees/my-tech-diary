### [Angular 2 versus React: There Will Be Blood](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51#.xnzo0ct8s)

#### For Angular

* Low Decision Fatigue
*　TypeScript
* React ismoving a little bit too fast, while Angular 2 is more discreet
* Less tooling required(compared to JSX)
* Easier to convert into Web Components
* From Angular 1: directives -> components, virtual DOM, isomorphic

#### For React

* Code completion for JSX(...)
* Errors in JSX can be reported at compile-time(while in Angular they are reported at runtime and are very confusing, though a new parser is on its way)
* React fails fast and loudly, and provides enough info(e.g. line numbers) for you, while Angular fails late and quitely
* React is JS-centric, Angular is HTML-centric. It's obvious that JS is more powerful than HTML, and putting things in HTML could easily becomes cryptic
* Development experience: code completion support + compile-time checks + rich error messages + hot reloading + time-travel debugging
* Much smaller footprint -- sure part of it is because React provides much less functionality, but most of the time you don't need them all anyway
* The Unix way

### [React’s JSX: The Other Side of the Coin](https://medium.com/@housecor/react-s-jsx-the-other-side-of-the-coin-2ace7ab62b98#.i3s6h7lgk)

* Unobtrusive JavaScript actually makes the code harder to maintain - how do you find the related JS code for a given DOM node? You'll have to search through the files for selectors, but sometimes it might not be that easy.
  * They are logically bounded together anyway, so why bother put them into separate files? Whenever you need to move them, you'll have to move them both.
  * You'll be afraid to change the markup, fearing it may break a jQuery selector
* Angular, Ember and Knockout put “JS” in your HTML. React puts “HTML” in your JS.
* Compile-time errors
* Power of JS
