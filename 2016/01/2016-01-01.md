## Node.js

### [Fluent 2013: Bill Scott, "Clash of the Titans: Releasing the Kraken | NodeJS @paypal"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZWGb0HU2QM)

* The old paypal uses Java for everything
  * You want to make an AJAX call? Oh yeah, subclass a Java controller -- everything is done at the server side, you don't get to write it in JS.
* The refactor of checkout follows the [lean UX](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021827.do) model
* Just do the design on the white board, and code it on the fly

#### Steps

1. Fire up a prototype stack
  * Open source
  * Express, connect, require.js
  * Bring in JavaScript templating
2. Bootstrap with bootstrap for rapid prototyping
3. Use JavaScript templating - dust.js
4. Make the UI bits portable to legacy
  * Drop the templates to rhinoscript(in Java)
5. Bring node to production with Kraken
6. One stack to rule them all
7. Modules for easy intergration
  * `bower.paypal.com` and `npm.paypal.com`
  * Use GitHub for continous deployment and CI

### [Node.js at PayPal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00ImeLt9ec)

* 2012 Node.js replaces Java/Spring
* 2013 Kraken.js open sourced
* Over 700 active Node.js devs at Paypal, many from a Java background
* 80+ apps in production

#### How they managed the transitions

* Three types of people
  * Influencer
  * Experts/Mentors
  * Community
* 8-people infrastructure team

#### Guiding principles

* Provide capabilities, not rails
  * You can't solve everybody's problems
* Design for reuse and DEPRECATION
  * Mistake: hardcoded grunt in the CI flow, now switched to npm scripts
* Be clear about your process
  * Try to operate as an open source organization
  * When to release, how they do code review, pull request
  * Be on the same slack channel
* Promote standards
  * The infrastructure team does have standards, and recommend the product teams to use it, but it is still up to the individual teams to decide if they want to use it
* No *let me google that for you*

#### The Node.js stack

* Kraken.js for prototyping(bootstrap, express)
* Construx(devtool) for watch and recompile JS/CSS etc.
* Lusca(security) kinda like [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet)
* Confit/meddleware(config)
* Kappa(npm proxy)

#### Challenges

* Mistakes: people don't want dust anymore, they want react
