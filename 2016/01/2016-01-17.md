## Languages

### SML

* Check the type first(static env), then evaluate(dynamic env)
* Comments are in `(* *)` and can be nested
* Expressions needs
  * Syntax
  * Type-checking rules
  * Evaluation rules
* All values are expressions, but not necessarily vice versa
* You can't do `if-then` without `else`
* `-` can't be unary operator
* You have to use `~`
`div` instead of `/`
