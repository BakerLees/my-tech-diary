### [Intent to Implement WASM in V8](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/v8-users/PInzACvS5I4/e2HflsbvCgAJ)

* Why
  * It improves upon asm.js
  * The WASM engine can just generate TurboFan's IR for fast compilation and good code quality, reusing the JIT and the runtime
  * Allows fast calls between WASM and JS
  * Can implement JS API to access WASM in V8
  * Still the same people(almost)
* [Code](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/4c5b3609fd4de3e0c1092373d1654862395ce40f)

### [Looking back on 2015: six exciting web technologies](http://www.2ality.com/2016/01/web-technologies-2015.html
)

#### Electron

Been writing one recently...

* Features
  * Automatic updates
  * Crash reports
  * Windows installers
  * Debugging and profiling
  * Native menus and notifications
* Users
  * VSC, slack, docker

#### React Native

* [An iOS Developer on React Native](https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/an-ios-developer-on-react-native-1f24786c29f0#.u4cc7v8p7)

* What impressed him
  * The React Paradigm
  * Flexbox
  * Live/Hot Reload
  * Cross-platform
* What he missed
  * IDE, autocomplete and documentation, version editor
  * Too many things to launch - terminal, sublime, Chrome, Xcode - Nuclide may be the rescue
  * APIs - you have to build bridges

Quote from [Andy Matuschak](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/560511204867575808)

> I say with confidence as a former UIKit author: React's model for the UI layer is vastly better than UIKit's. React Native is a *huge* deal.


#### [Progressive web apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps)

* Progressive enhancement
* Responsive UI
* Connectivity-independence
* App-like UI
* Continuous updates
* Secure communication via HTTP
* [App discovery](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/)
* Push interaction
* Natively installable
* Linkability

#### Visual studio code

Been using it these days, the debugger is suprisingly good.

#### Rollup

* Tree-shaking
  * Crucially depends on the static structure of ES6 modules.
* ES6 modules

#### Web Assembly

Keeping an eye on it.
