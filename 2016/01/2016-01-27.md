### [Hewitt, Meijer and Szyperski: The Actor Model (everything you wanted to know, but were afraid to ask)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Hewitt-Meijer-and-Szyperski-The-Actor-Model-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask)

* The system enforces the integrity of the addresses.
* Between the systems, encryption is used
* The original concept is more like *capabilities* instead of addresses, but addresses implies integrity and the only capability that comes with it(to send a message)
* The order of the delivered messages could be random, and they might get lost
* There is no channels, no overheads(besides, channels could be actors themselves)
* To inform about the order, send a sequence of futures
* Non-determinism v.s. indeterminism(what it's gonna be v.s. how it worked out)
* The problems about Petri nets are in fact, the problems of synchronizations
* Aribiters: [Indeterminacy in concurrent computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_in_concurrent_computation)
* *What is computation? Actor Model versus Turing's Model*
