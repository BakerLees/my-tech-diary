## Electron

Start building an app for my sister today...

* Based on [this](https://github.com/atom/electron-quick-start)
* Written the crawler and turned it into a lib. Used [node-fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) because I like fetch API, and [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) because it seems enough for my needs.
* Build the main page UI based on [angular material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/). For simplicity I just download it via npm and reference the scripts in the web page like `src="../node_modules/.."`
* Be sure to turn the strict mode on if you want to use ES6 features
* It's really convenient to directly `require` modules in the browser code

Proposals...intersting

* Static guarantees
* You can't change the export at runtime, but it's opt-in, it doesn't conflict with the CommonJS system i.e. it's not a breaking change.
* You can still do that to `exports`, it's just that you can't do that to ES6 `export`, so it's kinda like strict mode.
* The parse-then-populate process needs a hook from V8
* Need to immediately evaluate non-ES6 modules, but for ES6 modules we only need to gather the data gathered from parsing

#### Semantics

* ES6 modules = modules that use `import`/`export`
* Must be in strict mode
* Guarded against monkey patching(only new code in userland, the core modules will still be in CommonJS)
* Circular modules must be static. ES6 modules can't require CommonJS modules circularly

#### Loader

* [whatwg/loader](https://github.com/whatwg/loader)
* The registry is kinda like `require.cache`, and it's a real map
* It involves a promise, so it's breaking the synchronous `require`, but it's not necessary

#### Thoughts

Hmmm...If I can't monkey patch a ES6 module anymore, how can I mock it to test without worrying about dependencies?
