## Architecture

### [The Stack That Helped Medium Drive 2.6 Millennia of Reading Time](https://medium.com/medium-eng/the-stack-that-helped-medium-drive-2-6-millennia-of-reading-time-e56801f7c492#.itsyqpxnu)

#### Initial Stack

* Tech
  * Deployed on **EC2**
  * The main app was written in **Node.js**
  * Launched with **DynamoDB**(part of AWS)
  * **nginx** reverse proxy
* Topology
  * App servers
  * A node server for image processing(with GraphicsMagick...gm?)
  * A server as SQS queue processor for background task
* Other services
  * Amazon **SES** for emails
  * Amazon **S3** for static assets
  * Amazon **cloudfront** as CDN
  * **Datadog** for monitoring
  * **PagerDuty** for alerts
* Frontend
  * **TinyMCE**
  * **Closure** compiler & library
  * **Handlebars** for templates

#### Current Stack

* Operation
  * Amazon VPC
  * **Ansible** for system management. The configuration is under source control so that it can be rolled back easily.
* Services
  * SOA, a dozen services, some are more micro than the others
  * How to make the choice?
    * Specificity of the work
    * Changes across service boundaries caused by dependencies
* Server
  * Still in Node, reuse server and client code e.g. editor, post transformation
  * Problems: blocking the event loop
  * Solution: run multiple instances, route expensive endpoints to specific instances to isolate them
  * Hook into V8 runtime for insights
    * Hotspot: object reification during JSON deserialization
* Auxiliary services
  * Written in **Go**
  * Easy to build, package, deploy
  * Opiniated
* CDN
  * Serve static assets mainly via **CloudFlare**(for DDOS protection too)
  * 5% to **Fastly**, 5% to CloudFront to keep their caches warm for emergency
* Frontend of backend
  * Both nginx and **HAProxy** for the union of their functionalities
 * Monitoring
  * Still use Datadog and PagerDuty
  * ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for debugging in production
* DB
  * Mostly Amazon **DynamoDB**, some newer data stored in Amazon **Aurora**
  * **Redis** cache cluster to handle viral reads
  * **Neo4J** to store relations, a master with two replicas
 * Data Platform
  * Amazon **Redshift** as data warehouse, coutinously import data from Dynamo and logs from S3
  * Internal tool *Conduit* to manage scheduling, data dependencies and monitoring
  * Assertion-based scheduling model - jobs will only be executed if their dependencies are satisfied
  * **Spark** for ETL
  * **Protocol buffers** for schemas and rules to keep all layers in sync
* Images
  * The image server is now written in Go
  * Use **groupcache** for in-memory cache
  * Backed by a persistent **S3** cache
* TextShots
  * Powered by a small Go server which interfaces with **PhantomJS**
* Custom domains
  * HAProxy to manage certs and routing, integrate with Namecheap
* Web Frontend
  * Their own SPA framework taht uses Closure library, Closure templating for both client and server
  * Closure Compiler for minification and module spliting

#### Workflow

* **Jenkins** for CI
* Make -> Pants for build system
* Unit tests and HTTP level functional tests
