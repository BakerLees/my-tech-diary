## [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)

* Every change is contained in a state object
* The state tree is read-only, you have to dispatch an action to notify it for change
* Actions are plain JS objects, which must have a `type` property. How the related data is attached to it is up to you
* The components only dispatch actions, they are not responsible for updates
* States mutation are pure functions `(state, action) => state`. They are called *reducers*
* It's not necessarily slow: if you don't change the objects, just use the same old references, you don't need to copy time for each mutation
* Convention: for unknown actions, return the state as-is. And besure to return initial state when state is undefined.


#### What does a reducer lookes like

```javascript
const reducer = (state = 0 /* initial state */, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'A':
      return ...;
    case 'B':
      return ...;
    ...
    default:   // unkonwn action
      return state;  // as-is
  }
}
```

#### How to use it

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
const store = createStore(reducer);
store.getState(); // your initial state
store.dispatch({ type: 'A' })
let unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
  // will be called whenever the state changes
  store.getState();
})
unsubscribe();
```

#### Implementation

```javascript
const createStore = (reducer) => {
  let state;
  let listeners = [];
  const getState = () => state;

  const dispatch = ï¼ˆaction) => {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    listeners.forEach(listener => listener());
  }

  const subscribe = (listener) => {
    listeners.push(listener);
    // instead of providing an unsubscribe method,
    // return a function for removing this subscription
    return () => {
      listener = listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
    }
  }

  dispatch({});  // initialize

  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe };
}
```
