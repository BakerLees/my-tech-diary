## Node.js

### [Submitting a Pull Request to Node.js with ChakraCore](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/01/19/nodejs-chakracore-mainline/)

* Windows 7 SP1 and above
* Shim the V8 API
* Capabilities to turn off JIT compiler and specify thresholds for resource consumption
* NAN compatibility is guaranteed
* Wait, I see "Team foundation server" in the benchmark....what?
* They are teaming up with MSR to develop TTD
* The cross-platform support is interpreter-only at first

#### VM neutrality is the way to go

* M$ ships a Node.js on top of Chakra for XBOX, Windows Phone and Windows 10 IoT.
* [Enable Node.js to run with Microsoft's ChakraCore engine](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4765)
  * V8 and Chakra will sit down to talk
* [Should Node.js be VM neutral in the future?](https://github.com/nodejs/roadmap/issues/54)
* And, don't forget WebAssembly -- it's also driving the vendors towards a more neutral low-level API for JS VMs. Imagine `require('a-native-module-in-wasm')`...
