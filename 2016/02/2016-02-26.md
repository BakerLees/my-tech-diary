### [Firefox DevTools, React, and Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wseL3Vl-Hh4)

#### History

* Firefox DevTools is trying to get rid of XUL anyway, and React is a good option(no need to do documentation, .etc)
* XUL is like a hipster version of Web Components in early 2000s with a old flexbox system for layout(LOL)

#### Advantage

* React helped to eliminate a lot of race conditions. Things are just deterministic
* Easier than XUL for contributors to jump in
* Redux and React make it easier to locate the bug

#### Disadvantage

* It's hard to refactor the structure your app state if your view depends on it(e.g. switch from `this.state.foo.bar` to `this.state.bar.baz`)
* [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)(kinda like `computed` in Vue, actually)
  * Dan suggested placing selectors alongside reducers
* Hot module reloading

#### Quirks

* Can't integrate React DevTools just yet because it's a different env
* Redux DevTools works though
* Can't use JSX because build step issues
* No documentation for people not using JSX

#### Longevity

* The paradigm could survive far longer than React itself
* It's about avoiding shared state and coupling, and using pure functions to map states to views
* The counterargument for not adopting things is that it's gonna be so much harder to adopt new things when it does make a HUGE difference, because by then you will be so much further behind the evolution
