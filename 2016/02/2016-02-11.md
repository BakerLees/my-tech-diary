### [The Most Important C++ Software...Ever](http://www.artima.com/cppsource/top_cpp_software.html)

#### Cfront, 1985-1993

* Generate C as object code
* Need to use C debuggers and mentally unmangle names
* Easier to port
* Allowed users to see what is going on(hey, kinda like all those compile-to-js languages)
* Once de-facto, deminished after Annotated C++ Reference Manual cameout and it became clear that it's nearly impossible to have exceptions implemented

#### GCC, 1987-present

* Generate native code since day one
* Cross-compilation
* Although it brings a free, standard-comformant C++ frontend to the community, very little tools(e.g. lints, refactoring tools) are based on this and use all the parsing bits.
* Tools often use frontends that only parse the declaration, but not the definition
* The lack of good C++ parsers brought the lack of tools(note: due to the complexity of the language, it's nearly impossible to write a *right* C++ parser, clang is close though)

#### VC++, 1992-present

* Compiler, M$'s entire product line, API and tools
* Fell short of the standards for years
  * VC6 came out nearly a year after the first standard
  * VC7 was released in 2002, with an upgraded STL. VC7.1 was released in 2003(almost 6 years after VC6) and finally resloved most issues of standards conformance

#### STL, 1993-present

* Contributed not only containers and algorithms, but also the architecture based on iterators
* The idea that arrays are like containers and pointers are like iterators
* Extensibility
* Ranges
* Performance based on templates instead of OO

#### Boost, 1999-present

* Great impact on the specs
