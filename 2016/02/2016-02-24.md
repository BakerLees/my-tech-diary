### [Compositing in Blink and WebKit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpk1dYdo62o)

* Use **multiple backing stores** to **cache** and group chunks of the render tree
* If there's only one backing store(pixel buffer), there's no point for caching the whole view because it would invalidate quickly

#### Repaint v.s. redraw

* Repainting - figure out the color of the pixels.
* Redrawing - display the calculated colors
* Obviously, redrawing is much cheaper than repainting. Caching the result of painting

#### Use cases

When using multiple backing stores, more cached results can be used later. e.g.

* When transforming a transparent layer, no repainting is needed(because the colors are already calculated), just redraw them(and let blending do the work)
* Instead of repainting the whole screen when scrolling, just repaint the new visible area, and shift the painted pixels upwards

#### Why compositing

* Avoid unnecessary repainting
* Making some features more efficient and practical
  * Scrolling, 3D CSS, opacity, filters, WebGL, hardware video decoding

#### Tasks

* How to group contents in backing stores(composited layers)
* Paint(figure out the colors of) each layer
* Draw the layers(the job of the compositor)
