#### Data Structure

* `cc` is Chromium Compositor
* Blink will output a tree of `cc:Layer` for compositing. These are composited layers(the abstract class for them are `WebCore::GraphicsLayer`).
* Chromium will ask Blink to render the contents of each layer
* `WebKit::WebLayer` and `Web::WebLayerImpl` are the Bilnk-side interface for `cc:Layer`
* `WebCore::GraphicsLayerChromium`, the Chromium-specific implementation of `WebCore::GraphicsLayer`, manages up to three `cc:Layer`
* The tree of `WebCore::GraphicsLayer` roughly corresponds to the tree of `cc::Layer` by one-to-one
  * You can't be certain about the relation ship though, all you know is what group of `WebCore::GraphicsLayer` a `WebCore::RenderLayerBacking` corresponds to
* `WebCore::RenderLayerBacking` holds one or more `WebCore::GraphicsLayer` and may have a backing store if it draws content
* `WebCore::RenderLayer`: the input of the problem

#### Why does `CompositedLayerMapping` have so many `GraphicsLayers`?

* A separate layer for scrollbars
* Layers to clip a subtree or group siblings(which typically do not draw content)
* Separates background and/or foreground if convenient/necessary
  * e.g. `background-position:fixed`, negative z-order children with composited content
* Group content that would scroll
* Implicit layers for masking and reflection

#### Code Path - painting

* `GraphicsLayerChromium::paint()` invokes painting for a particular composited layer.
* `RenderLayer::paintLayerContents()` paints the content of a composited layer recursively(except descendant composited content)
* A `GraphicsContext *` is passed around to represent what the layers will be painted into, and it's a interface to call the drawing commands given by the 2D drawing library
* `GraphicsLayerPaintingPhase` is used for the render layers to identify which layers they should be painted into
* The compositor's job is to
  * Determine **when to paint**
  * Gives `RenderLayers` the appropriate context and phase

#### Code path - which layer to composite?

* `RenderLayerCompositor::updateCompositingLayers()` compute the tree of composited layers, given the tree of render layers
* `RenderLayerCompositor::computeCompositingRequirements()` determines which `RenderLayer` should be composited and allocates/deallocates backing stores
  * Recursively checks children, in correct paint order
  * `RenderLayerCompositor::needsToBeComposited()`
  * `RenderLayerCompositor::requiresCompositingLayer()`
  * Maintain a `CompositingState` to track the need for overlap testing and if something in the subtree is already composited, so that it can make better decisions later
  * Maintain an `OverlapMap` of rectangles from previously composited content. Anything that overlaps existing composited layers should be composited too
  * Maintain `RenderGeometryMap` to track how to convert boundraries to a common space for overlap testing
  * Maintain a stack of lists. Pushed when entering a container layer that doesn't need to test overlap outside its context (i.e. a composited container)
* `RenderLayerCompositor::rebuildCompositingLayerTree()` reconstruct the composited layer tree based on the results of `RenderLayerCompositor::computeCompositingRequirements()`
  * For each `CompositedLayerMapping`, figure out its chunk of composited `GraphicsLayer` tree
  * `CompositedLayerMapping::updateGraphicsLayerConfiguration()` finds out which internal `GraphicsLayer` will exists and computes the tree topology
    * Each `GraphicsLayer` has a *phase* to paint.
    * Explicit phases: background, foreground, mask..
    * Implicit phases: scrollbars...
  * `CompositedLayerMapping::updateGraphicsLayerGeometry()` sets properties for each composited layer: bounds, position, visibility, transforms, opacity...
  * Recurses and  stitches together the entire composited tree

#### The Dark Side of Compositing

* Computational costs
  * How to group contents into composited layers
  * Checking for overlap
  * Managing another layer tree(three more)
* Memory costs
  * Backing store for composited layers
* Precision
  * Antialiasing around edges, but not inside(cached pixel data)
  * LCD Text Antialiasing might not be feasible(unless it's certain that the composited layer is opaque)
  * OMG a problem about text flickering I ran into ealier suddenly makes sense to me...because there are transitions of transform(makes a composited layer) and opacity(so there's a switch of antialiasing)
* Effeciency
  * If we have to repaint everything all the time anyway, compositing doesn't help
  * Rasterization/shaders/blitting bandwidth bottleneck(especially on a lightweight mobile GPU)
