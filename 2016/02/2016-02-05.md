## Haskell

### [A History of Haskell: being lazy with class](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/)

* 1970-1980s: Pure functional programming, recursion, comprehension, pattern matching, lazy functional programing, Lisp machines, "All you need is Lambda", SK combinator, graph reduction, dataflow architecures
* Backus 1978: Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?
  * FP is respectable
* New conferences, languages, compilers, crchitectures
* FPCA Sep. 1987: intial meeting for a common language(2.5 year later, the Haskell 1.0 report came out)
* John Hugh: Why functional programming matters

#### Monads

* Laziness keeps you pure, no side effects - say NO to I/O, exception, references
* Salvation through monads
* Syntactic sugar do-notation: imperative look-and-feel
* Mix both imperative programming and functional programming
* Allows not-that-pure functions with **fine-grained control about exactly what kind of side effects are allowed**, while keeping the laws of FP true

#### Safety & Usefulness

* Hasekll: useless and safe -> useful and safe
  * Along the way: Monads
  * Default: no effects
  * Plan: selectively permit effects(types play a major role)
* Other langauges: Useful and dangerous -> useful and safe
  * Along the way: regions, ownership types, Vault, Cyclone
  * Default: any effect is fine
  * Plan: add restrictions(types play a major role)

#### Type classes

* This is how it reads: A type `a` lies in class `Eq` if it has a equality method that has type `a -> a -> Bool`

  ```haskell
  class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  ```
* This is how it reads: The type `Int` does indeed lie in the class `Eq` by witnessing the fact that there is an equality method that has the type `Int -> Int -> Bool`

  ```haskell
  instance Eq Int where
    i1 == i2 = eqInt i1 i2
  ```
* This is how it reads: The type `[a]`, list of `a`, lies in the class `Eq` if `a` lies in the class `Eq`,by witnessing the fact that there is an equality method that has the type

  ```haskell
  instance (Eq a) => Eq [a] where
    []     == []     = True
    (x:xs) == (y:ys) = (x == y) && (xs == ys)
  ```
* The functions that needs this type class can use it in the type declaration now:
  ```haskell
  member :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
  member x []                  = False
  member x (y:ys) | x == y     = True
                  | otherwise  = member x ys
  ```
* Dictionary-based implementation: use dictionaries of methods for each type class, and pass in those methods for function that needs the type class at runtime
* Quickcheck

#### Process and community

* Much superficial complexity
* No formal semantics
* Deeply held principles
