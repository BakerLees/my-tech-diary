## Hot Reloading

### [Dan Abramov - Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel at react-europe 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs)

* React hot loader work with Webpack hot module replacement, using *proxies* to update the code
* Thanks to pure `render()`
* React hot loader doesn't work well with Flux
  * Components and action creators are fine
  * But stores are stateful -> not *pure*
* Trim the store down to one function: `(state, action) => state`
  * Similar to reducer `(acc, val) => acc`
  * `actions.reduce(store, [])`
