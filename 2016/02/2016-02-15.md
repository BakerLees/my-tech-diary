### [The evolution of Lua](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1238846)

* Design
  * Interpreted and dynamically typed
  * Incremental GC
  * Strong support for strings
  * Coroutines, first-class functions with lexical scoping, proper tail calls
* Embeddable
  * Implemented as a library
  * Clear API for host applications
  * Not just the implementation, but the design also makes it easy
  * Just realized how many games I've played use Lua for scripting....

#### 1992 Tecgraf

* PUC-Rio and Petrobras
* Little languages
  * DEL: Data Entry language
    * For data entry
    * Name, type, default values
  * SOL: Simple Object Language
    * Not totally unline XML
    * BibTeX-like syntax
  * PGM to visualize geologic profiles
* Limitations
  * No expressions, lack of abstractions
* Needs
  * A generic configuration language
  * A complete language
  * Embeddable
  * Portable
    * Petrobras has many kinds of machines
  * Simple
  * Non-intimidating syntax
* The Name
  * Sol is the sun, Lua is the moon

#### Lua 1.0 (1993)

* Implementation
  * Implemented as a library
  * Precompiler with **yacc/lex**
  * Opcodes for a **stack-based VM**
  * less than 6000 lines of C
* Tables
  * Associative arrays
  * The only data structure(records, lists, objects are just special cases)
  * Linked list in 1.0

#### Lua 1.1 (1994)

* Improvements
* Performance improvements
  * Use hash for tables
* Reference manual
* Well-defined and well-documented C API

#### Lua 2.1 (1995)

* Pressure for OO features(super-hype at that time)
  * Tables + first-class functions ~ objects
  * Added syntatic suger(`:`)
  * Delegation & prototype-based OO, inspired by Self
  * Inheritance done with fallbacks
* Cleaner C API
  * No more direct references from C to Lua objects
* No more `@`, simpler syntax
* Exception handling with resumption
* Several breaking changes

#### Lua 2.2 - 2.5 (1995-1996)

* External precompiler(metafiles)
* Debug facilities
* Pattern matching

#### Lua 3.0 (1997)

* Tags - improvement over fallbacks
  * Each object has a numerical tag
  * Fallbacks associated with a tag are called **tag methods**
  * Breaking change -- compatibility script

#### Lua 3.1 (1998)

* Functional features
  * Anonymous, nested function
  * `function f...`
* Problems with lexical scoping implementation
  * Lua was doing on-the-fly compilation with no intermediate representation
  * Activation records in the stack
* Upvalues
  * The frozen value(copy) of an external local variable inside a nested function
  * Special syntax(`%`) to avoid misunderstanding, like `final` in Java

#### Lua 3.2 (1999)

* Multithreading(wanted by web servers)
* Multiple **independent** Lua *processes* with their own states and no shared memory
* Used a single C global variable pointing to the running state, and provided C API functions to set the running state(not very satisfactory)

#### Lua 4.0 (2000)

* All functions got a new parameter(the state)
  * No more C global variables now
  * Breaking change
* Improve the API
  * Stack oriented

#### Plans Lua 4.1 (2001)

* Game developers wanted multithreading for multiple characters
* Problems with multithreading
  * Preemption and shared memory
  * Not portable
  * Hard to get it right, hard to debug
  * It's proposed for OS, not for applications
* Introduced **coroutines**
  * Portable
  * Deterministic
  * Coroutine + scheduler = non-preemptive multithreading
  * Could be the basis for multithreading if anyone really wants it
* New algorithm for upvalues
  * Real lexical scoping
* New algorithm for tables
  * Store arrays in an actual array
* **Register-based VM**(for fun, and it worked rather well)
* Tags replaced by **metatables**
  * Tables storing metamethods(tag methods)

Too much for a minor release, packed into Lua 5

#### Lua 5 (2003)

* Coroutines, lecical scoping, metatables, boolean types, weak tables, proper tail calls, modules(breaking)
* Modules
  * Prior to Lua 5, modules could be done with tables
  * In Lua 5, it's made a policy and didn't add anything to the language

#### Lua 5.1 (2006)

* Incremental GC
  * Soft-realtime demand from games
* More policies for modules, functions to help "good practice"
* Support dynamic libraries
  * Not portable

#### Q&A

* Why no `case`
  * It's kinda like `goto`, if you need labels, you're gonna need constants
  * Lua doesn't have constants
* How embeddabilities influences the language design
  * It's almost impossible to implement continuations in Lua because Lua code and C code could be mixed on the stack
  * But it's possible to implement subcontinuations as long as there's no C code on the stack
