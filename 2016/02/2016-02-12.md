* Do not give in on user experience because of developer experience
  * Build tools, frameworks, etc.
* Frameworks are not necessarily faster(the myth of *DOM is slow*)
  * It takes time an money to learn them beyond the "Hello World" level
  * Sooner or later, you are going to debug the frameworks
  * Takes time to load & eats battery, CPU, memory
* Problems with transpilers
  * Extra step
  * They must take the responsibility for generating efficient and succinct code
  * Browsers can't get enough feedbacks(leads to lack of optimization)

> There are a lot of tools to compile es2015 to es5. When choosing your compile stack you should be aware that tools that perform **tree shaking** and **topological sorts of your code dependencies** will result in smaller code bundles and faster js execution times.
