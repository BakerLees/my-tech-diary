* The web is so successful and powerful because it isn't controlled by one group, project, or organisation.

* [WebDriver Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)
* It goes through a selenium server(HTTP proxy + launcher)

## Stuff

### Reverse a single linked-list, the cheap way

```cpp
Node* reverse(Node *root) {
  Node *new_root = NULL;

  while(root) {
    Node *next = root->next;
    root->next = new_root;
    new_root = root;
    root = next;
  }

  return new_root;
}
```
