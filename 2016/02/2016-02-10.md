## C++

### [The Most Important C++ Books...Ever](http://www.artima.com/cppsource/top_cpp_books.html)

#### The C++ Programming Language Cover The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup

* The book that started it all
* Terse, but every line is important

#### Effective C++ by Scott Meyers

* The right book published at the right time
* Focused on how to use the language, avoid common pitfalls, leverage non-C features, in the form of guidelines

#### Design Patterns by Erich Gamma

You konw...patterns.

#### International Standard for C++

> Prior to the standard, the best way to figure out what was valid C++ was to read Margaret Ellis’ and Bjarne Stroustrup’s The Annotated C++ Reference Manual (Addison-Wesley, 1990—commonly known as the ARM), check your code with several compilers, and try to read Bjarne Stroustrup’s mind (possibly using his book as a proxy).

#### Modern C++ Design by Andrei Alexandrescu

* Demonstrated that templates are far more useful beyond "containers of T"(although STL in the 1998 spec already required that, but it was this book that introduced the ideas into the community)
* *Modern C++* generally refers to code employing template techniques the book popularized

### [The Most Important C++ Non-Book Publications...Ever](http://www.artima.com/cppsource/top_cpp_publications.html)

#### [Programming in C++, Rules and Recommendations](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/cplus/c++.rules/)

* What to do and what not to do(kinda like Effective c++)
* First written in Swedish, later translated into English
* Took 4 years to make a book
* Lost its edge and became out-of-date when it was finally published

#### [Exception Handling: A False Sense of Security](http://www.awprofessional.com/content/images/020163371x/supplements/Exception_Handling_Article.html)

> The really hard part of using exceptions is to write all the intervening code [between the throw and the catch] in such a way that an arbitrary exception can propagate from its throw site to its handler, arriving safely and without damaging other parts of the program along the way.

* There's some kind of sumgness in the C++ community at that time..the exception looked like a sliver bullet, and then this came out.
* Brought a challenge: to publish an **exception-safe stack class**
* Ended the innocence for C++

#### Curiously Recurring Template Patterns

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Base { ... };

class Derived: public Base<Derived>
{ ... };
```

Reassured people wondering if their code(that could compile) was insane.

#### [Using C++ Template Metaprograms](http://osl.iu.edu/~tveldhui/papers/Template-Metaprograms/meta-art.html)

* The first large-scale public appearance of template metaprogramming
* Compile-time loops -> recursively instantiated templates
* Compile-time condition -> template specialization

#### [Exception-Safety in Generic Components](http://www.boost.org/more/generic_exception_safety.html)

The three possible exception-safety guarantees a function can offer: **basic, strong, nothrow**
