## HOPL

### [Self](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1238853)

* SOAR: Smalltalk on a RISC -> compilation make things fast, duh.
* Smalltalk
  * Creative medium, usable by children
  * Window-menu-mouse paradigm
* Alternative Reality Kit
  * Visual programming
  * Object seems real, with mass and velocity
  * Messages instead of variables
  * Prototypes - maybe **copying a fully instantiated object** is preferrable to instantiating from a planned model like what you do in a class-based system!

#### self-descriptive

* In 1985, the Smalltalk group was split into small teams to create strawmen for the next language
* Make objects purely self-descriptive(like object literals, instead of seperating the class and the instances)

#### No classes

* For uniformatiy, classes are objects, and they needs classes for them, so you got all these crazy classes and metaclasses in the Smalltalk
* So they decided to just throw away these classes
* No assigments, all you can do to the obejcts is sending messages
  * In Smalltalk, once you are in the obejct, it's more like Pascal really, LOL...

#### Added

* Implicit `self`(C++ has this too)
* Slot list syntax
* Parent slots
  * Objects inherit from objects
  * Global state for free
* Changing state to behavior(JS got its methods and prototypes stuff from here)

#### The implementation: Self-89

* Aspired to Smalltalk performance
* 33,000 lines of C++
* Maps
  * Common data in the prototype is in an object called *map*(invisible to the programmer)
  * Objects has pointers back to the prototype(like `__proto__` in JS)
* Making it fast
  * Dynamic dispatch is slow
  * Customization(bit like hidden  classes)
  * Polymorphic inline cache
* Adptive compilation
  * Optimizations are expensive
  * Compile first, then optimize using PIC(containing type feedback) for hot spots
  * 80/20 rule of thumb
  * Recompile at idle time/in background

#### Transporter

* Do type inference and shrinkwrap what you actually needs(10MB image to 0.8MB image)

#### Animated Objects

* Objects are physical and real
* No global namespace, just put them on top of the prototype trees
* Kept categories
* Disney Animation
* Motion blur, anticipation, slow in/slow out
* Reasonable animations(scale instead of fade in...very material design LOL)

#### UI2

* Direct UI objects(take buttons, move it around, .etc.)
* Unify use/mention
* Layout as object
* Ouliners & slots
* The 95 demo looks...surreal...
* WYSIWITYS - *What you see is what I think you see*

#### Business and cancellation

* Footprint was an issue(~20MB)
* Execution speed
  * 3x~6x slower than optimized C
  * 20% faster than fully virtual C++
  * 2.5x faster than Smalltalk
* Compilation and recompilation only took seconds, while C++ could take hours
* Cancelled in the end
* 9 months to wrap it up
  * Built the fastest Smalltalk system in the world
* Urs and Lars went to do Strongtalk
  * Smalltalk with optional types
  * Small footprint interpreter
  * Made a JVM(because no one wanted Smalltalk) and got acquired by Sun(that later became HotSpot JVM)

#### Q&A

* JavaScript didn't pick up the reflection(so it doesn't scale)
