## History

### [JavaScript Air Episode 000: The past, present, and future of JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg4e-2lBw5E)

* WebAssembly, in its texual format, is essentially Lisp...illuminating.

#### What JavaScript would be like if it's done as *Scheme in the browser*

* Macros, lots of macros
* callcc
* A lot of reivented wheels

#### Origin of coersions

* `==` was not originally designed to have this weird coersion
* LiveWire needed to deal with numeric strings in HTTP headers, forms
* So, to answer the needs of the LiveWire team, the coersion was added
* When standardizing the language, Guy Steele proposed to add an additional operator for equality(Common Lips has FIVE anyway), Shon proposed `===`
* BE wanted a JavaScript 1.0 and just fix that, but compatibility was a problem

#### SPA

* People started building SPAs right after Netscape2 came out
* Build steps and compilers got adoption in the community, which speeded up the pace of evolution

#### Composition

* The time was not enough so a lot of stuff were made **composite**
* Functions can serve as methods, procedures, constructors, lambdas/function expressions
* Objects can serve as dictionaries and have prototype chains that could be *polluted*
* Things like CommonJS paved the way so they wouldn't build a highway to nowhere

#### WebAssembly

* One-VM is essential, as the failure of Dart VM has already proved(host-guest conflicts, GC cycles, .etc)
* Mapped to the hardware(in a safe-portable way), interoperable with SIMD, GPU, threads

#### Static Typing

* We need to wait and see things like Flow/TypeScript get adopted in the community, and not rush into anything until we have a sort of de-facto standard
* There might be a standard for tool-time type system, but not in the runtime
* Typed-Racket and have both modules with dynamic typing and modules with static typing, and objects can be wrapped in proxy-like thingy and flow from a dynamic module to a static one. When there's an error, it will appear at runtime.
* It's not yet clear that we could benefit from static checking at runtime, and it could bring metaprogramming stuff that's hard to optimize

#### Node.js

* JavaScript on the server is not a new thing, but Node.js hit the right time

#### Swift

* It could be compiled to JavaScript anyway(and it's LLVM-based from the beginning!)
