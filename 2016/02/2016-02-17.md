## History

### [The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript](http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/a-z_programming_languages_javascript/)

> We saw Java as the "component language" used by higher-priced programmers, where the glue programmers -- the Web page designers -- would assemble components and automate their interactions using JS.

* JS as the assembly of the Web stresses different optimization paths in the engines, and pushes different features to the standard
* ECMAScript sounded like *eczema*, LOL

* The type system is there for developer experience, which leads to a lot of interesting designing choices
* Interfaces should be extendable(by other files)
* The type system is essentially modeled after the runtime object model. It tries to mirror the actual API and all the (additional) functionalities in different objects, which is important for tooling
