### [is express dying?](https://github.com/strongloop/express/issues/2844) & [Add initial TLP application for express](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/39)

TL;DR:

* Express was sold to StrongLoop, and therefore became the property of IBM when IBM brought StrongLoop.
* Open Source community(e.g. GitHub orgnizations) can't own properties, the only way to do it legally is to transfer the ownership to a REAL orgnization e.g. the Node.js Foundation. Then the orgnization can decide who can have a say in the project(in these cases it's kinda like a trust).
* I believe both sides meant well...it's just the inefficiency of big companies and lack of communication that caused all these drama.
