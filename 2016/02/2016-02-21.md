## ES2016

### `Array.prototype.includes`

#### Starting off: early 2012

`String.prototype.contains` in ES6 - [[[harmony:string_extras]]](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:string_extras) - basically a wrapper around `String.prototype.indexOf()`
* Why not add one to the Array? - [Array.prototype.contains](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/array-prototype-contains)
* Motivation: DOM added [`DOMStringList`](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#DOMStringList) purely for this method. APIs returning it used to return Arrays, and they had to gave up all the array methods for this. With this coming around, `DOMStringList` can be obsoleted
  * Well actually...no, they also have `.item()`
* Problems: should we fix the equality issue(which was wrong in `indexOf`, where `[3.0, NaN, 4.0].indexOf(NaN) == -1`)?
  * BTW, `===` is not reflexive in JS because `NaN !== NaN`, so it doesn't form a equivalence class

#### Picked up: late 2012

* Got positive responses, but has issues and no one stood up to be a champion
* Break MooTools
* Got a written proposal, with `SameValue`(like in maps) instead of `===` for equality
* [strawman:array.prototype.has](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:array.prototype.has)

#### Why not `has`?

1. Consistent with `String.prototype.contains`, and saying a string *has* a substring is weird
2. Consistent with `DOMStringList`
[Array.prototype.contains](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/244797871dfa8fd475fd593821605fee14d2cb05/es6/2014-07/jul-31.md#57-arrayprototypecontains). Since it will have `Array` on its prototype chain, having both `contains` for itself and `has` inherited from the Array would be weird
3. `has` looks for key, `contains` looks for value

#### Picked up again: early 2014

* Pretty likely not gonna make it to the ES6, had to wait for ES7
* Could've push it through the post-ES6 spec process more quickly, but nah...
* [Approved for the ES7 process](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es6/2014-04/apr-9.md#45-arrayprototypecontains), started **Stage 0**

#### Stage 1

* [2014, 07](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/244797871dfa8fd475fd593821605fee14d2cb05/es6/2014-07/jul-31.md#57-arrayprototypecontains)

#### Problem with MooTools(2014, 09)

* [Having a non-enumerable Array.prototype.contains may not be  web-compatible](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/having-a-non-enumerable-array-prototype-contains-may-not-be-web-compatible) and [Bug 1075059 - non-enumerable Array.prototype.contains is not web-compatible (breaks jsfiddle.net)](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1075059)
  * MooTools fixed this quickly
  * By then the stats for MooTools were 1.32% on top 10k sites, 3.05% on top 100k sites, 4.78% on top million sites, and 6.39% overall.
  * And JSFiddle used that, too
* [Response from a MooTools core dev](https://gist.github.com/fakedarren/28953b01e455078fb4f8)
  * Basically saying it's the frameworks modifying prototypes that got JavaScript this far, even though it is a bad idea, it's not fair to judge them by the decisions they made so long ago
* Note: W3C once insisted on `Event` despite the one defined by MooTools at that time. And they won. MooTools deprecated `Event` and switched to `DOMEvent` instead
* [Discussion about Array.prototype.contains solutions](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/array-prototype-contains-solutions)
  * Personally, I don't think renaming solves the real problem here. There are too many obsolete frameworks in the wild modifying prototypes. What can you do, avoid all the good names because they are already taken by some old framework?
* In [TC39 meeting, 2014, 11](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/244797871dfa8fd475fd593821605fee14d2cb05/es6/2014-11/nov-18.md#44-arrayprototypecontains-breaks-mootools) changed both methods in `String` and `Array` to `includes`
