## JavaScript

### [You should use [insert library/framework], it's the bestestest! / Paul Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yCz1TA0EL4)

* Every framework has best practices to learn
* Costs
  * Learning it
  * Re-learning it
  * Debugging
* User costs
  * Time
  * Bandwidth
  * CPU usage(battery)
  * Frame rate
  * Memory usage
* [Big Rig](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/big-rig)
  * TodoMVC in vanilla JS outperforms those built with frameworks by ~10x or more

### [Choosing the webâ€™s future](http://quirksmode.org/presentations/Autumn2015/goingwrong_fowa.pdf)

Don't really agree with most of the points...but I'll keep my mind open.

* Problems
  * It's impossible to emulate the native apps
  * The browsers should slow down the making of new features
  * Stop focusing too much on the tools
  * The web is not one platform.
* The true JavaScripter
  * Uses libraries and frameworks when he needs
  * Studies them in detail before doing so
  * Prefers to use a single one per project
  * Is able to write a medium-complex pplication without any libraries or frameworks
  * Has the technical background to change a library or framework if necessary
* The Web's real strengths
  * URL
  * Reachability
  * Simplicity
