## asm.js

### [Cheerp 1.1 - C++ for the Web with fast startup times, dynamic memory and now, more speed!](http://leaningtech.com/cheerp/blog/2015/06/17/Cheerp-1.1)

* 3x ~ 10x slower than the native

#### v.s. Emscripten

* Emscripten ports C++ by emulating a flat, byte addressable address space of traditional architectures using **a large, monolithic, JS TypedArray**
  * Requires pre-allocation, has to know the maximum memory size at build time and cannot allocate memory dynamically
* Cheerp maps C++ objects to JS objects
  * This requires **stricter type safety** in C++, so more porting work needs to be made(usually around 0.1%), but porting works is unevitable anyway(interfacing DOM, removing threading code, .etc.)
  * No intrinsic memory limitations
  * More secure, avoid the heap or stack overflows brought by the TypedArray approach

### [Cheerp 1.2 - C++ to JavaScript with faster execution and startup, smaller output](http://blog.leaningtech.com/2016/02/cheerp-12-c-to-javascript-with-faster.html)


* Supports 64-bit integers, RTTI, `dynamic_cast`, covariant return types, modules(experimental)
* `PreExecuter` converts C++ code used to initialize global structures into simple data, significantly reducing output code size
* 2x ~ 6x slower than the native now
* 10x ~ 11x faster startup time, 2x ~ 3x faster execution time than ecmscripten in split memory mode

### [Memory growth is being removed from asm.js](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/emscripten-discuss/09E_WEk193E)
> If you look at the recent activity in the first link, vendors have recently decided to remove memory growth from asm.js. The reasoning is
>
> 1. It's not fast in Chrome and Safari, so many projects using memory growth haven't been using asm.js anyhow.
> 2. On the other hand, WebAssembly is getting closer, and in v1 it will have memory growth as a standard feature, which we can expect will be fast in all browsers, consistently and properly.
> 3. Removing memory growth from asm.js removes a bunch of complex code from JS engines, which is safer and also allows faster progress towards WebAssembly.
