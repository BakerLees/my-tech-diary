## Haskell

### [Haskell is Not For Production and Other Tales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTO510zO78)

* Haxl & Sigma rule engine, serving millions of requests per day

#### Architecture

* Sigma Server in C++(thrift)
* Execution Layer, client code(rules), Haxel & libraries in Haskell
* Haxl Data Sources in Haskell/C++
* Existing data sources in C++(e.g. memcache)

#### Pros

* No need to be explicit about what should be concurrent and how it should be done(e.g. caching), because people tend to get these wrong, and Haxl would just take care of all these.
* Strong static typing: wrapping types to prevent people screwing up the order of parameters(well...named parameters kinda solve this too)
* Compilation makes it run faster
* Runtime linker and unlinker for hot replacement
* Enable replay in debugging

#### Tales of Haksell

* Not difficult, but different. You just can expect to rely on your experience in other languages.
* Abstractions are hard: Monads, lens, .etc.
Type errors
* Don't mention monads, just teach them do notations
