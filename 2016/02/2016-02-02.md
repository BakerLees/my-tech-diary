### [Introducing Background Sync](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync?hl=en)

* Then problem description is gold, LOL(I hate `onbeforeunload`)
* The demo looks awesome

#### How to use it

```javascript
// first, register your service worker
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');


// when your service worker is ready,
// get the registration (e.g. via `navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then`)
// then use `reg.sync` to fire the sync event
reg.sync.register('sync-event-tag');


// in your worker
// this handler will be called repeatedly
self.addEventListener('sync', function(e) {
  if (e.tag === 'sync-event-tag') {
    // if the promise rejected, another sync will be scheduled
    // with an exponential back-off,
    // or fired when the connectivity resumes
    event.waitUntil(doStuffAndReturnPromise());
  }
})
```

#### Note

* Sync with the same tag will be re-tried together
* The sync will go on even after the user navigates away, closes the tab, or even closes the browser(running in the background)
* Notification needs permission, background sync doesn't. So there are rules:
  * Sync event registeration is only available **when there's a window open** to the site
  * The **execution time is capped**. Don't bother using it to mine bitcoin or ping servers.
* Safari and Edge fall short on service workers now...
* This could be shipped in the first half of 2016, and they are working on a *periodicsync* too.
