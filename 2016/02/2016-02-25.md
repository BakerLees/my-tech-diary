### [Compositing in Blink and WebKit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpk1dYdo62o)

#### Stacking contexts

* Created by positioned(relative, absolute, fixed(non-standard)) elements with z-index
* Can be nested
* **Flatten** its subtrees before being rendered
* Can be treated as an **atomic conceptual layer**
* Good for deciding paint orders

#### (Simplified) paint order of a stacking context

1. Background and borders
2. Negative z-index children
3. Normal flow elements
4. 0 z-  index children/absolute positioned children
5. Positive z-index children

#### Implementation

* The `RenderLayer` tree coarsely approximate the DOM
* The layers are then collated to form a *paint-order-tree*

#### Reasons to make a composited layer

* Benefits from being cached/grouped
* Opacity, transforms(can just apply matrices to CPU), filters(e.g. blur), reflections
* Scrolling, fixed-position elements
* Things that are rendered differently
  * WebGL, hardware decoded videos, .etc.
* RenderLayers overlapping a composited layer
* Some children(to propagay transform, preserve-3d, clipping, .etc)
* **Composited children with negative z-index** will make the parent composited too
* Assume anything **on top of a composited layer that animates** will overlap(to save the calculation for animated stuff). Moving stuff down can help you avoid this.
* **Children of a composited layer** will be composited together with it. Since we know they are in the same stacking context, we don't have to check for overlapping between the children and the stuff outside of this context

#### Simplified algorithm

Iterate the children of the paint-order tree(nodes are RenderLayers), for each layer

1. Figure out if the layer should be composited due to **overlapping**
  * If something might be **animated behind it**, just assume it needs to be composited
  * Iterate over previously composited layers and check for intersection
2. Figure out if the layer should be composited due to **its own properties**
3. Recurse for children
4. Figure out if the layer should be composited due to **the status of its subtrees**
5. Invalidate its content if its compositing state changes

#### Flags

* `--force-compositing-mode`
* `--show-composited-layer-borders`
* `--show-paint-rect`: layers that need repainting. It'd be better not to see a lot of them
* `--show-property-changed-rects`: layers that need redrawing without repainting. It'd be better to see quite a few of them

#### Demo

* Layers subject to a 3D transformation could be rendered onto a *render surface*, to which the transformation will be applied
