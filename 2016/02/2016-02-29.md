### [A new approach to Function.prototype.bind](http://benediktmeurer.de/2015/12/25/a-new-approach-to-function-prototype-bind/)

* Previously, on every possible `[[Call]]`, we bailout to C++ at least twice([code](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/fc23b4949850e68a0877e3426c438ce0f710613d/src/js/v8natives.js#L1239))
  * Into `%BoundFunctionGetBindings`, which returns a new array: [the bound target function, the bound `this`, the bound `arguments`]
  * Into `%Apply`, which **calls back into JavaScript** to execute the actual target function with the actual parameters
* Why it's costly
  * Building temporary arrays on every invocation of a bound function is not cheap and puts pressure on GC
  * Calling into C++ is certainly not fast in V8, but calling back from C++ into JavaScript is very expensive
* [This improvments](https://codereview.chromium.org/1542963002) is also a part of a bigger project for implementing Proxy
* This will hopefully help apps using React, which uses `Function.prototype.bind` heavily.
  * Apart from the throughput of bound function, the performance of `Function.prototype.bind` also needs improvments to reduce latency and startup time

In the same quest of avoiding JS -> C++ -> JS calls, SpiderMonkey approached this by putting the code on the JS side...hmmm..

Oh, that's not nice...
