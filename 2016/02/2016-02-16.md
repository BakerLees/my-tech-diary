## History

### [A Short History of JavaScript](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript)

* ES4 started in 2000, led by Waldemar Horwat
* At first M$ seemed to participate and **implemented some proposals in JScript.net**, but they had no intention to bring it to IE
* By 2003, JS2/ES4 was monthballed
* In 2005, BE and Mozilla rejonied ECMA as a Non-for-profit member
* Work started on E4X, ECMA-357
* Macromedia were implementing E4X in AS3(fork of Waldemar's JS2/ES4)
* Then ES4 restarted to standardize AS3 and implement it in SpiderMonkey. Adobe released Tarmarin
  * But Tarmarin and AS3 were **too different from JavaScript to converge**, but it was not realized until 2007-2008
* Doug Crockford joined M$ in 2007 to oppose ES4
* Meanwhile, Ajax and things like Prototype, jQuery, Dojo and Mootools happened
  * Note: this also explains why they tend to extend the prototype, because the language evolution was stalked then.
* In July of 2008, a meeting was held in Oslo. In early 2009 they agreed to rename ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript 5, and Harmony was born.

### [JavaScript creator ponders past, future](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2653798/application-development/javascript-creator-ponders-past--future.html)

* Vision for ES4
  * Types and interfaces
  * Less mutable
* Dispute
  * M$ focused on ES3.1, which was mostly bugfix and stardization of existing features
  * Firefox already moved way beyond that, and didn't want to look back
* Screaming Monkey
  * Get IE to support ES4 via Flash(how weird does it sound...)
