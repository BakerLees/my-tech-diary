## Rust

###ã€€[Add support local mirrors of registries](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/2361)

* 1:1 mirrors
* crates.io is the source of truth for all crates
* Portable lock files
* sha256 checksum in the lock file to assure the rebuildability
* Local registries

## Node.js

### [Callbacks VS Promises](https://gist.github.com/creationix/b9557dd1dceba7aa90b5)

* Callbacks are essentially your program's continuation in a language that doesn't support first-class continuations or coroutines
* Proposed in 2010

  ```javascript
  fs.readFile("path")(handleData, handleError);
  ```
  Dropped for performance reasons and the learning cost of a new abstraction
* New proposal in 2016

  ```javascript
  fs.readFile("path")(function (err, data) {
    // handle stuff as normal
  });
  ```
