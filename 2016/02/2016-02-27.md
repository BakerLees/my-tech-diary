## React

### [React Components, Elements, and Instances](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html)

#### The traditional OO way

*ã€€Each component instance has to **keep references** to its DOM node and to the instances of the children components
* They need to **manage the lifetime** of its children correctly
* And it becomes **harder to decouple** the components

#### Elements

* An element is a plain object describing a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties
* **They are not actual instances, just immutable descriptions(in the form of objects) with two fields** -- `type` and `props`. They are building blocks for describing how the tree is structured, what the relationships among those instances are
* The `type` of an element can be
  * String: a tag name
  * A function or a class corresponding to a React component -- these are custom elements
* Using elements as descriptions helps to **decouple the components**
  * With elements, you can express *is-a* and *has-a* relationships exclusively through **composition**

#### Components

* For a React component, props are the input, and an element tree is the output
* This lets you compose independent parts of UI without relying on their internal DOM structure
* React takes care of managing the instances
* The three ways to create a component are mostly equivalent
  * As a (pure) function: less *powerful* in the sense that it can't have state, but this purity brings other goodies
  * From `React.createClass` factory or by extending `React.Component`: almost the same, the syntax differs

#### Reconciliation

* When calling `React.render()` or `setState`, React will ask the Component(recursively) with a bunch of properties until it gets a detailed description of the element tree
* Then renderer like react-dom or react-native applies the minimal set of changes necessary to update the DOM nodes
* You can optimize by telling react to skip the process for components deemed unchanged by your logic. It is very fast to calculate whether the props have changed if they are immutable.
* Only components declared as classes have instances(functional components don't), and they are mostly **managed by React**
