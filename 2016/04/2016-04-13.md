## [An ES Modules Show](http://nodeup.com/ninetynine)

* Splited into language spec(handled ECMA-262) and loader spec(managed by WHATWG)
* The language part is settled, the loader is still on the way
* V8 and Chakra have already implemented the parsers
* Interoperability(can't break all the existing modules)
* How to help the package authors distribute the ES modules
* ES Modules are static(/declarative) in that after the module is parsed, you can be sure about the namespace.(But you can change what those names refer to)
  * Good for dead code elimination
  * Incompatible with the monkey-patchable `require`
  * It's designed for browsers(can have `<script type="...">`), not necessarily suitable for other environments
* Two proposals standing out
  * Some fields in the package.json
  * New extensions(e.g. `.jsm`)
* Won't be in v6, probably in v8, might need years for the community to migrate
