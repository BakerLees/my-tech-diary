### [A Malloc Tutorial](http://www.inf.udec.cl/~leo/Malloc_tutorial.pdf)

#### What's malloc
* `mallloc` is not a syscall.
* It's a standard C library function
* Allocates at least the number of bytes requested
* Returns a pointer to the allocated space(which cannot be allocated by any other call to `malloc` again until it's freed)
* Terminates as soon as possible(can't be NP-hard)
* Comes with implementations of `free` and `realloc`

#### The heap

* Each process has its own virtual address space(translated into physical memory space by the MMU and the kernel)
* The heap is continuous(at least in terms of virtual addresses)
* The heap has three bounds
  * Starting point
  * A break, which marks the boundary between mapped memory space and unmapped memory space
  * The maxium limit, `rlimit`(managed via `getrlimit`(2) and `setrlimit`(2) in `sys/ressource.h`)

#### Unmapped regions

* Accessing addresses above the break should trigger a *bus error*
* The unmapped space is maintained by the virtual memory manager
* Memories are, of course, organized in pages(frames for physical memory), often of fixed size(on most system, 4096 bytes). So chances are the break is not on the boundary of any page
* **No man's land**: the space between the break and the next page boundary(should the break not lie on a boundary)
  * This space can be accessed, and it's often a root of bugs. This is the reason why you can step outside of the space you've allocated by a little bit(until it cross the page boundary)

#### Syscalls

* `int brk(const void *addr)` places the break at `addr`, returns 0 if successful, -1 otherwise.
  * The global `errno` contains the error
* `void *sbrk(intptr_t incr)` moves the break by `incr`(in bytes), returns the previous or the new break(depends on implementation), or `(void *) -1` if it fails
  * Sets `errno` if it fails, too
  * In some systems, you can pass in negative values to free memory
  * Although the returned value is implementation-dependent, there is one thing we can be sure about: `sbrk(0)` will return the break address
* `void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset)` can be used to directly map files in memory
  * In annonymous mode you can use it to allocate memory by pages, and use `munmap` to free it
  * Many `malloc` implementations use it

#### The quick and dirty version

```c
void *malloc(size_t size) {
  void *p = sbrk(0);  /* get the initial break */

  if (sbrk(size) == (void*) -1)  /* fails */
    return NULL;

  return p;  /* succeed */
}
```

This is obviously a terrible idea since you can't implement `free` or `realloc` with it
