## Node

Node v6.0.0 is out today! Looking forward for the new LTS.

A quick summary: updated to V8 5.x(93% ES6 support, modules are still on the way though), changes to buffer APIs(zero-filled behind flags), faster `require`(4x, see [#5123](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5123) and [#5172](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5172)), more tests

## Rust

### [Xi editor: A modern editor with a backend written in Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/4glski/xi_editor_a_modern_editor_with_a_backend_written/)

* It's not really a Google project, the author releases this under the name of Google  for that 20% free time
* The editor is split into frontend and backend, all operations are async for responsiveness
* The frontend uses native UI framework(Cocoa & Swift)
* The backend is written in Rust for performance and abstractions
* The backend uses persistent [ropes](shttps://github.com/google/xi-editor/blob/master/rust/rope/src/rope.rs) for handling large files efficiently
* Uses pipes to communicate with plugins(can be written in any language), JSON for backend/frontend communication
