## [Open Source Swift Under the Hood](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/swift-open-source)

### Where did Swift come from

* Objective-C was created as a smalltalk-like runtime on top of C
* Objective-C and Smalltalk are dymaically dispatched, while Swift is statically dispatched
* CPU grows faster than memory, memory latency became the bottleneck, cache locality became important
* Interpoerability with ObjC
* No undefined behavior, no nasal daemon

#### Features

* Modules, namespaces
  * Objective-C: Foundation, UIKit, SpriteKit
  * C wrappers: Dispatch, SIMD, Darwin(native C libraries)
  * Swift: Swift(automaically imported), Builtin(native tpes)
* Types
  * Reference types(class),value types(struct)
  * Protocols(interface)
  * Extension(add methods/protocols to existing type)
  * Numeric values are represented as structs, copied by value into arguments, can inherit protocols and extensions
* Functional constructs
* Improtantly

### What makes Swift fast

* It's fast compared to other languages on LLVM e.g. Objective-C
* Seperating reference types and value types helps
* Memory optimization
  * Contiguous arrays, better locality, less fragmentation
* Static dispatch and dynamic dispatch
  * Static dispatch directly `call 0x12345678`, allows for CPU optimization(predictable)
  * Dynamic dispatch effectively `call(cache["methodName"])`(hand tuned asm, still overhead)
* Inlining, reduce function prologue/epilog(stack/register spill), reduces branch miss and memory jumps
* Peehole optimizations
* LLVM linker reads all files and can optimize them in a way that can't be acheived if it's only able to read one single file at a time
  * `final` methods and data can be inlined
  * Structs are always `final`
  * `private`(same file), `internal`(same module)

### New stuff

* Modules
  * `module.modulemap` [standard Clang feature](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html)
* `build` (like rust cargo)
  * `PackageDescription` module
  * `Package.swift`
* Conditional compilation for platform-dependent code
  * Not a real preprocessor, limited to `#if` and logical operators
* Targets
  * Multiple targets
  * `main.swift` for command line tool
  * Modules is named after the parent directory
  * Can be described in the package file

### Compilation

* AST -> -> parsed AST(type resolved) -> SIL(similar to LLVM IL but has swift specifics) -> IR -> assembly/bitcode/library
* Name mangling(`_T`, type, module, name length, name, inferred type, arguments, return value)
  * `swift-demangle`
* Method lookup implemented somewhat like vTable
* Default arguments
  * Translated into function type, called and then passed to the function each time the function is invoked
  * For future-proof in case the default arguments needs to be results of function calls
  * Caching
* Errors
  * Wrapped up in a 2-tuple
  * If the second item is not null, then the error will be raised
  * This changes the call signature
* RefCounting
  * `@weak` required to avoid circular references
* [SIL Inspector](https://github.com/alblue/SILInspector)
* Interoperate with Objective-C
  * Objective-C calls swift, nothing much to change. Swift instances in memory has `isa` pointers
  * Swift calls Objective-C, a lot of stuff needs to be converted
  * When you mark your code Objective-C(`@objc`), it will use the dynamic dispatch and you will loose all the static optimiztion of Swift
  * Also applies to
    * Subclassing Objective-C classes
    * Implement ingObjective-C protocol
* Advices
  * Be careful about default parameters and hidden costs of passing structs to functions
  * Embedded struct values are performant
  * `final`, `private`, `internal` for inlining
  * Avoid circular references counted class types

### Future

* As fast or faster than Objective-C, more optimizations to come
* Easy on the memory and battery
* Don't compare it to C, they have different goals
* Binary compatibility, no need to share source
* Full generics
* Won't be compatible with C++ and won't be source compatible with Swift 2.x(will have fix-ups)
* Won't have macros
