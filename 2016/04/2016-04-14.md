## React

### [React Native on the Universal Windows Platform](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/04/13/react-native-on-the-universal-windows-platform/)

* This includes: core framework support, tools(vscode extension), services(CodePush, which push live updates to users)
* I do agree with the idea behind React Native: what we need is not "write once, run everywhere", but "learn once, write everwhere". Different platforms have **different design philosophies** anyway, you can't just port apps from one platform to another. Just because it works doesn't mean it's good to go.
* The view managers and native modules are implemented in C#, and the view managers instantiate and operate on XAML elements
* Chakra is used for JavaScript runtime(so no additional package needed)
