### [Bug 1237782 - Remove support for appcache](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1237782#c34)

> For this reason, the first step browsers should take is to disable appcache for insecure contexts.

It does make a point. If the manifest is tampered with by MITM, it's a pretty damn bad security problem(with a lifetime longer than you think).

The validating and updating process really needs to be improved..
