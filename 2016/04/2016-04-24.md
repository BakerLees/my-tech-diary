### [Jank Busters Part Two: Orinoco](http://v8project.blogspot.de/2016/04/jank-busters-part-two-orinoco.html)

* Orinoco: a **mostly parallel and concurrent** garbage collector **without strict generational boundaries**
  * Not behind a flag, shipped icrenmentally

#### Parallel compaction

* Cause of jank: objects are moved first, then  the pointers are updated, all in sequential order
* Young generation evacuation = one scanvage GC + moving objects surviving another GC to old generation
* Old generation compaction: some holes are reused via free lists, others requires compaction(move live objects to a better packed page)
* These are now **parallelized on page-level**
* There are no dependencies between young generation evacuation and old generation compaction, so they are parallelized
* **Compaction time is reduced 75%**

#### Parallel remembered set processing

* Pointers in the remembered set(as cache for pointers that needs to be updated)
  * That may move during GC
  * From old genration to the new generation(because all new generation objects move on GC)
  * In heavily fragmented pages(because they could move during compaction)
* Old remembered sets were implmented as **array of pointer addresses**, or *store buffers*, one for the young generation and one for each fragmented old generation pages(1+n)
  * Contains all **incoming pointers**
  * Entries are appended in a write barrier
  * Can be duplicated, which makes it hard to parallelize since two threads trying to update the same pointer can cause **data race**
* New remembered sets are implmented as **bucket of bitmaps storing offsets of pointers**(in fixed length)
  * No duplicate now, just disjoint sets, and the new data structure is denser
  * No more remembered set overflow handling
* **Maximum pause time of compaction reduced by 45%**

#### Black allocation

* Objects allocated in the old generation are **marked black immediately**. They are, by defnition, live, and are allocated on *black pages*
* Reason: objects allocated in the old generation are likely long living, and should at least survive one GC, otherwise they were falsely promoted.
* Speeds up increnmental marking(will be skipped)
* In Octane: **throughput and latency are improved by ~30%, using 20% less memory**
