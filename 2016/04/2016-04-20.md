### [A Malloc Tutorial](http://www.inf.udec.cl/~leo/Malloc_tutorial.pdf)

#### Metadata

* Keep metadata in front of the allocated blocks(the pointer returned by `malloc` will be right after this metadata)

  ```c
  typedef struct s_block *t_block;

  struct s_block {
    size_t   size;  /* size of the block */
    t_block  next;  /* point to the next block */
    int      free;  /* flag indicating if the block is free */
  }
  ```
* We use `int` for the flag because it will be aligned anyway
* It is, in fact, a linked list

#### First-fit implementation

* The first-fit algorithm
  * Traverse the chunks list and stop when we find the first free block that's big enough
* We need to align the size of the data block by `size_t`(e.g. 4bytes, depends on the platform)
  * The formula is `(x - 1) / 4 * 4 + 4`
  * To do this in bitwise operations: `#define align4(x) (((((x) - 1) >> 2)<< 2) + 4)`

```c
t_block find_block(
  t_block *last, /* out argument, point to the last visited chunk */
  size_t size /* size of memory to allocate */) {
  /* base is a global pointer to the base address of the heap */
  t_block b = base;

  /* find the first suitable block */
  while (b && !(b-> free && b->size >= size)) {
    *last = b;  /* update last as we go */
    b = b->next;
  }

  /* if we couldn't find it, b will be NULL */
  return (b);
}
```

#### Extending the heap

* When we couldn't find a fitting chunck, or when we are at the beginnig of the program, we can extend the heap to get more available chunks
* A macro to get the size of metadata: `#define BLOCK_SIZE sizeof(struct s_block)`

```c
t_block extend_heap(
  t_block last /* point to the last visited chunck */,
  size_t s/* size of the data in the new block */) {
  t_block b;  /* our new block */

  b = sbrk(0);  /* get the current break */
  if (sbrk(BLOCK_SIZE + s) === (void*) -1) {
    /* fails to move the break, can't do anything about it */
    return (NULL);
  }

  /* initialize our new block */
  b->size = s;
  b->next = NULL;

  if (last) {  /* not the first call */
    last->next = b;  /* append it to the linked list */
  } /* else, just leave it there until it's visited */

  b->free = 0;  /* just for convenience, you'll see */
  return (b);
}
```

#### Splitting the block

* To avoid the waste of space
* A simple trick to make sure the operations are done in one byte precision

  ```c
  struct s_block {
    size_t  size;
    t_block next;
    int     free;
    char    data[1];  /* it just point to the end of the metadata */
  }

  #define BLOCK_SIZE 12  /* update it */
  ```

  `data` doesn't really take up any space. It's of size 1 because C forbids zero-length data. It's `char *` so it's in one-byte precision(`data + 1` will just bump one more byte). It will, however, affect `sizeof struct s_block`(one more pointer)

```c
void split_block(
  t_block b /* the block to split */,
  size_t s /* size of the first part of the split */) {
  t_block new = b->data + s;  /* second block */
  new->size = b->size - s - BLOCK_SIZE;  /* remaining space */
  new->next = b->next;  /* to the block after b */
  new->free = 1;
  b->size = s;  /* shrink it */
  b->next = new;  /* to the second block */
}
```

#### Implementing `malloc`

```c
/* initialize so we know if malloc is called the first time */
void *base = NULL;


void *malloc(size_t size) {
  t_block b, last;
  size_t s = align4(size);  /* it needs to be aligned */

  if (base) {  /* called before */
    last = base;
    b = find_block(&last, s);  /* find the first fit */
    if (b) { /* found */
      /* the remaining space is enough for
        a new block of at least 4 bytes of data */
      if (b->size -s >= BLOCK_SIZE + 4) {
        split_block(b, s)  /* don't waste it */
      }

      b->free = 0;  /* it's allocated now */
    } else {
      /* can't find a fitting block, try to extend the heap */
      b = extend_heap(last, s);
      /* notice b->free is set to 1 in extend_heap */
      if (!b) {  /* can't extend the heap, fails! */
        return NULL;
      }
    }
  } else { /* malloc is called the first time */
    /* need to extend the heap anyway */
    b = extend_heap(NULL, s);
    if (!b) {
      return NULL;  /* oops, just fails */
    }
    base = b;  /* initialize it, that's our base address of the heap */
  }

  return b->data;
}
```
