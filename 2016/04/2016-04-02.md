### [Why in JavaScript 10 === 010 is false](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30386993/why-in-javascript-does-10-010-result-in-false)

* Because numbers start with `0`, by default, are **octals**. So `010 === 8`.
* However if you have `8` or `9` in the number, then they will be interpreted as decimals!
* And, **this doesn't work in strict mode!**(`SyntaxError`)
* Why is it like this? Well..compatibility reasons, of course.

### [About rel=noopener](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/)

* Tabs opened with `target="_blank"` has `window.opener` that points to the `window` of the opening page.
  * This works on cross-origin pages too!
  * Fortunately, not everything is accessible via `window.opener`. For example, `window.opener.document` is still subject to CORS(so stuff like cookies are still in the right hands)
  * But things like `window.opener.location` are accessible, so the opened page can redirect you to a phishing page and whatnot.
* Solution: use `rel="noopener"` to make sure `window.opener` is `null`.
  * For older browsers, use `rel="noreferrer"`(this also disables `Referer` HTTP header though)
  * Or, use this JS code

    ```javascript
    var otherWindow = window.open();
    otherWindow.opener = null;  // set this manually
    otherWindow.location = url;
    ```
