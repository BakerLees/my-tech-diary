## Erlang

### [Why Erlang Matters](https://sameroom.io/blog/why-erlang-matters/)

* Using SMP doesn't mean you don't need to copy data(since you can share memory instead of passing messages), because you still have **cache coherence**. The copying just takes place inside your computer's interconnect, instead of inside a network.
* The thing is, cache coherence does not scale. The more CPU cores you have, the harder it will be.
* Hardware threads are used when communication is more frequent or the amount of shared data is substantial. Networked processes are used when scaling requirements are less predictable, or fault tolerance is required.
* Mainframes became too powerful for normal applications, thus rose the PCs. One day PC will become too powerful too, then the virtualization will take place again.

#### Erlang

* Erlang uses **immutability** and **single assignment** enforced by the VM to tack the problem of concurrency and reliability
* On top of immutability, the VM can define lightweight processes passing messages. This makes independent GC possible, so it doesn't have to stop the world.
* The **supervision tree** helps to promte the least amount of error handling in favor of quickly crashing processes
* Erlang brings a uniformed message passing model(between and inside computers) and hot reloading
* Immutability removes the need for cache coherence
* Processes are load-balanced to evenly saturate the available CPU cores and maintain cache locality
