### Programming Lanuguages

* You cannot mutate stuff in ML. What you've got, is shadowing.
* Expressions in variable bindings are evaluated eagerly
* In types, `*` is just a separator
* Functions must be declared before they are used
* Type-check of function bodies
  * It knows the enclosing static environment
  * It knows the arguments
  * It can recur
* Pairs
  * `(e1, e2)`, `#1 e` and `#2 e`
  * if `e1` is of type `t1`, `e2` is of type `t2`, then `e` is of type `t1 * t2`
* Lists
  * Variable length, homogeneous
  * `[v1, v2, .. vn]`
  * cons: `1 :: [1,2,3]` is `[1,1,2,3]`
  * `null e` to test for emptyness
  * `hd e` and `tl e` to access the head(an element) and the tail(list of remaining elements)
  * Types: `t list`(list of type t) and `'a list`(list of any type)
* In ML, generating lists and iterating over lists usually involves recursion.
* Iteration
  * What should the answer be for an empty list?
  * What should the answer be for a non-empty list?(Typically in terms of the answer for the tail of the list)
* Generation
  * Create lists out of smaller lists
