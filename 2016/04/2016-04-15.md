## How to debug corruptions in C++

### Steps

1. Get a core dump if possible
  * If it doesn't, make sure it does, and wait until the bug resurface
  * Or use assert to make sure it always crashes as soon as possible after any corruption happens, so you can find a more consisten pattern
2. Trace to the corruption site
3. Check the vicinity of the site.
  1. Figure out what variables could cause the corruption by reading your code and reason about the memory layout(e.g. adjacent data members in a class), and check if there are overwrites to those variables
  2. Another possibility is that the corruption is caused by some random uninitialized pointer(so you can't figure out what it is by reading the code). Then you need to look at the corrupted memory and find some patterns(strings, structures) that can help you identify the suspect. This might need you to have a good understanding of the whole code base.

### Global memory corruption

* Common sources
  * Underflow or overflow of adjacent global structures
  * Writing to uninitialized pointers(this is rather random)

### Heap corruption

* Common source
  * Writing outside of allocated memory
  * Writing to uninitialized pointers(this is rather random)
  * Casting to the wrong type
  * Typo between `->` and `.`, `&` and `*`
  * Mixing `new []` with `new` or `delete []` with `delete`
  * `delete` or `free` the same memory twice
  * Calling the wrong destructor, e.g. polymorphic base classes without virtual destructors
  * Stack overflow(since heap and stack grow to each other)
* Symptons
  * When bookkeeping information written by things like `new`/`malloc` are corrupted(e.g. by overwrites), things that use this information `free`/`realloc`/`delete` can cause a crash
  * This can also cause crashes on OS code by corrupting OS buffer linked list
* A useful trick: overload `new`/`delete` and put an `int` containing some numbers on the boundaries of the object to help you check for corruption

### Stack corruption

* This is usually easier since the source of corruption usually is near the site of the corruption in the code(but there are exceptions)
* Common source
  * Casting local variables to the wrong type
  * Writing outside of local buffers
  * Stack overflow(from the stack of another function)
  * Writing to uninitialized pointers(this is rather random)
  * Heap overflow(since heap and stack grow to each other)
* Symptons
  * Always crashes when a function/interrupt/service routine returns(since the return address is on the stack)
  * The parameters doesn't match what's being passed by the caller(since the parameters are on the stack)
  * Register corruption during context switch(another thread or program corrupted the context)

### Invalid object pointers

* When you always crash when calling a method that access data members, chances are the object pointer(i.e. `this`) is invalid.
* It could be a null pointer(e.g. returned by a failed `new`)
* It could be a pointer to an object that's already destructed by another thread

### Corrupted vtable pointer

* When you always crashes when calling a virtual function, chances are the v-table pointer(note: not the content inside the vtable, that's read-only) of that instance is corrupted
* Common source
  * Writing outside of the base part of a derived object, since the v-table pointer usually lies between the boundary between the base part and the derived part
  * `memset` the dereived object without knowing the actual underlying layout of the object
  * Casting the derived object to the wrong type and modifying it
  * The instance is already destructed/not yet fully constructed in another thread when the virtual function is called
