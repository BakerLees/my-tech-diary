### [JSZap: Compressing JavaScript Code](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/livshits/papers/pdf/webapps10c.pdf)

* Since JS has a well-defined grammar, JS programs can be transformed into three streams: AST production rules, identifiers, and literals, each of which can be compressed independently
  * Source maps use this property of JS too
* Advantages
  * Easier to check if the AST is well-formed, safe, and intact
  * Fine-grained caches and updates to individual functions, modules, etc.
