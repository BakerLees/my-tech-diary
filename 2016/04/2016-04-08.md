## [Bill Buxton & Erik Meijer - Perspectives on Design](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/NicFill/Channel-9-Live-at-MIX10-Bill-Buxton--Erik-Meijer-Perspectives-on-Design)

* Structure engineering & Architect v.s. Software engineer & designers
* De stijl movement
* The design is not finished when there's nothing more to add, but when there's nothing more to take out
* The fanaticism of adding features to software is somewhat like baroque/neoclassicism
* EM quoting AH: programming languages age. Eventually you will have to move on when there are too many features added to it.
* Renaissance is impossible: awareness, literacy, and expertise
* There has been a tradition in math that people use whitespaces to layout the symbols in a more readable way(i.e. typography). Haskell and Python are two languages that inherit this.
* Use BNF to analyze action complexity....wow
* Did a little googling...these looks interesting
  * [The cognitive structure of surprise: looking for basic principles](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.212.6732&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

### [Lamport timestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps)

Used to order events in a distributed system.

Sending messages:

```
time = time+1;
time_stamp = time;
send(Message, time_stamp);
The algorithm for receiving a message:
```
Receving messages:

```
(message, time_stamp) = receive();
time = max(time_stamp, time)+1;
```

If two entities do not exchange any messages, then they probably do not need to share a common clock; events occurring on those entities are termed as concurrent events.
