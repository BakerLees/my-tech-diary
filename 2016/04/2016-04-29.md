### [Announcing Vue.js 2.0](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/announcing-vue-js-2-0-8af1bde7ab9#.119frupmo)

* Overall it's more React-ish now..
* Introduced virtual DOM, initial rendering speed and memory consumption are improved. This is good since I always find it too heavy in these two aspects.
* Got some dark magic optimization going on
* Can freeze the data and manually update the view now, good news for some of my super jank-prone components
* Supports templates/JSX/Hyperscript. Sometimes the JS-in-HTML templates are just too inexpressive, so yay for me.
* Don't care much about server-side rendering and weex though.
* Some of the [breaking changes](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/wiki/2.0-features) I care about:
  * Filters are gone now. I can live without them(they are sometimes limiting anyway)
  * Events are gone too. It would be hard to let them go. The wiki suggests using global event bus or vuex, but these stuff can't help me with some recursive or generated components - for these I need scopes for events, and these workarounds don't really meet my needs. I'll be forced to add a bunch of ids to everything dispatched from these components, so I can discriminate them in the global scope...and then I need to manipulate the data point inside of one gigantic store, it cerntainly won't be helping me with those complex updates triggered by mousemoves...
  * `v-el` will be `v-ref`..meh
