## Vue

### [[Feature] Passing props to partials](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/2004)

Partials are kinda like..closures

> The while point of partials is that they are scope-less (i.e. evaluated in surrounding scope). If you want prop passing, use dynamic components.

#### [Special Elements - <partial>](https://vuejs.org/api/#partial)

```javascript
// msg will be evaluated in the parent's scope
Vue.partial('my-partial', '<p>This is a partial! {{msg}}</p>')
```

```html
<!-- a static partial -->
<partial name="my-partial"></partial>

<!-- a dynamic partial -->
<!-- renders partial with id === vm.partialId -->
<partial v-bind:name="partialId"></partial>
```

### [Dynamic components](http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Dynamic-Components)

```javascript
new Vue({
  el: 'body',
  data: {
    currentView: 'home'
  },
  components: {
    home: { /* ... */ },
    posts: { /* ... */ },
    archive: { /* ... */ }
  }
})
```

```html
<component :is="currentView">
  <!-- component changes when vm.currentview changes! -->
</component>
```

## FP

* Dynamic dispatch and pattern matching are in essense, the same thing
* Functional languages tend to use list heavily
* In OOP, the receiver(object) is the most important thing(`receiver.method(message)`), while in FP, the function is the most important thing(`function arguments`)
* Languages tend to use the least amount of space to represent the operators that they use most, and these operators usually has the highest priority
* Because IDE can help you along when you write OO code, you don't have to remember all the methods available. You can start with the data, then figure out how to achieve what you want.
* But when you write FP code, you take the initiative, and you need to remember much more stuff so you can spend less time staring at the blank screen.
