### [InsideReCaptcha](https://github.com/neuroradiology/InsideReCaptcha)

* An AJAX response contains code `recaptcha.anchor.Main.init(url, data)`, where `url` is a base64-encoded string and `data` contains double-based64-encoded binary data
* `url` points to a JS file which contains the code of a **bytecode interpreter**, `data` is bytecode
* The bytecode is encrypted with **XTEA**(decryption and encryption function are the same), it can access the JS variables of its own interpreter and can change its own opcodes
* They bytecode key is generated by hashing the JS code of the interpreter(`Function.prototype.toString()`), or with the output of browser-specific functions, CSS rules, hostname of the calling domain, .etc.
* The entropy includes
  * Plugins
  * UA
  * Screen resolution
  * Execution time, timezone
  * Number of mouse actions
  * Behavior of browser-specific things(checked alongside with UA)
  * Rendering of canvas elements
  * (Possibly) Cookies
