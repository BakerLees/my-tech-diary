## Stuff

### [I am Miguel de Icaza. I started Xamarin, Mono, Gnome with great friends. Ask me anything!](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerchat/comments/4dxpcp/i_am_miguel_de_icaza_i_started_xamarin_mono_gnome/)

* Just realized how important definely typed is to the interoperability of languages compiled to WebAssembly...
* Unity has joined the .NET foundation and starts to upgrade Mono for C# 6([blog](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/04/01/unity-joins-the-net-foundation/)).
* [This](http://websharper.com/) looks absolutely fantastic

### [React v15.0](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/04/07/react-v15.html)

* `data-reactid` is gone, thanks to the usage of `document.createElement`over `innerHTML`. Historically `innerHTML` has been faster, but it's not that true now. Besides, `document.createElement` makes data caching much easier and less error-prone.
  * They still exist in server-side rendered content though
* Texts are no longer surrounded by `<span>`, but by comment nodes, and rendering `null` now uses comment nodes. This could potentially break your tests.
* It's now 145.4K minimized(43K gzipped). The **complete SVG support** contributed 39K(3K gzipped). It's not a wrong choice(it's smaller than most images, and a good SVG support surely helps you get rid of them), but I do think they should provide a modular way for people to customize the build(not everyone or every page needs dynamic SVG, after all)
* Functional components can now return `null` too. Now you only have three ways to define class components(`React.Component`, `React.createClass()` and functions).
* The Facebook codebase has over 20,000 React components, and thatâ€™s not even counting React Native. WOW.
* `React.cloneElement()` now resolves to `defaultProps` instead of `undefined`
* The underlying format of `ReactPerf.getLastMeasurements()` are changed
