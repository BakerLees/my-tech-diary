### [Why we Need WebAssembly An Interview with Brendan Eich](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-we-need-webassembly-an-interview-with-brendan-eich-7fb2a60b0723#.cg3ru7jyc)

* With enough browser support, wasm can start to grow extra semantics that need not be put into JavaScript
* Features can be added to both JS and wasm(it's essentially one VM), but some stuff not suitable for JS can be put into wasm for the benefit of other langauges, e.g.
  * **Shared memory array buffers** are necessary for multi-threaded code compiled from other languages, but JS is designed in a single-threaded context
  * **Zero cost exceptions** doesn't really make sense in JavaScript, but does for C++, Swift, etc.
  * **call/cc** is hard to implement in JavaScript engines and brings security risks
* Wasm started out as the target for static languages, and it will be a while before wasm added more support(e.g. GC, JIT) for dynamic langauges
* The web has learned to iterate instead of getting a huge spec implemented over one night
* JavaScript will be the lingua franca of the browser
